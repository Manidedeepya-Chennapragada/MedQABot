how to prevent high blood pressure ?,"two key measures are used to determine if someone is overweight or obese. these are body mass index, or bmi, and waist circumference. body mass index (bmi) is a measure of weight in relation to height, and provides an estimate of your total body fat. as your bmi goes up, so do your chances of getting high blood pressure, heart disease, and other health problems. a bmi - below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight. - between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the healthy range. - between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight. - of 30 or more is considered obese. below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight. between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the healthy range. between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight. of 30 or more is considered obese. see the body mass index table, available from the national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi). body mass index (bmi) applies to both men and women, but it does have some limits. - it may overestimate body fat in in someone who is very muscular or who has swelling from fluid retention (called edema) - it may underestimate body fat in older persons and others who have lost muscle mass. it may overestimate body fat in in someone who is very muscular or who has swelling from fluid retention (called edema) it may underestimate body fat in older persons and others who have lost muscle mass. thats why waist measurement is often checked as well. another reason is that too much body fat in the stomach area also increases disease risk. a waist measurement of more than 35 inches in women and more than 40 inches in men is considered high."
what are the symptoms of urinary tract infections ?,"symptoms of a urinary tract infection (uti) in the bladder may include - cloudy, bloody, or foul-smelling urine - pain or burning during urination - strong and frequent need to urinate, even right after emptying the bladder - a mild fever below 101 degrees fahrenheit in some people. cloudy, bloody, or foul-smelling urine pain or burning during urination strong and frequent need to urinate, even right after emptying the bladder a mild fever below 101 degrees fahrenheit in some people. if the uti spreads to the kidneys, symptoms may include - chills and shaking - night sweats - feeling tired or generally ill - fever above 101 degrees fahrenheit - pain in the side, back, or groin - flushed, warm, or reddened skin - mental changes or confusion - nausea and vomiting - very bad abdominal pain in some people. chills and shaking night sweats feeling tired or generally ill fever above 101 degrees fahrenheit pain in the side, back, or groin flushed, warm, or reddened skin mental changes or confusion nausea and vomiting very bad abdominal pain in some people. symptoms may vary symptoms may differ depending on age, gender, and catheter use. in some elderly people, mental changes and confusion may be the only signs of a uti. older women and men with a uti are more likely to be tired, shaky, and weak. they are also more likely to have muscle aches and abdominal pain. in a person with a catheter, the only symptom may be fever that does not have another likely cause. germs without symptoms some people may have germs in the bladder or urinary tract, but not feel any symptoms. if a urine test shows that you have germs in your urine, but you do not feel any symptoms, you may not need any treatment. if you have germs in your urine but you feel okay, talk to your health care provider about whether antibiotics -- the medications that treat utis -- are needed. diagnosis to find out if a person has a uti, the health care provider will ask about symptoms. he or she will then test a sample of urine. the urine test looks for bacteria that may cause the infection. the urine test also looks for white blood cells, which the body makes to fight infection. because healthy people sometimes have bacteria in their urine, both bacteria and white blood cells must be in the urine to diagnose a uti. if a person has utis often, the health care provider may order some extra tests to see if the persons urinary tract is normal.

what are the treatments for urinary tract infections ?,"because most utis are caused by bacteria, bacteria-fighting medications called antibiotics are the usual treatment. the type of antibiotic and length of treatment depend on the patients history and the type of bacteria causing the infection. bladder infections may eventually get better on their own. but antibiotics can make the symptoms go away much more quickly. people usually feel better within a day or two of starting antibiotics. drinking lots of fluids and urinating often may also speed healing. if needed, pain-killers can relieve the pain of a uti. a heating pad on the back or abdomen may also help. learn more about treating urinary tract infections."
what are the treatments for osteoarthritis ?,"treatment goals: manage pain, improve function osteoarthritis treatment plans often include ways to manage pain and improve function. such plans can include exercise, rest and joint care, pain relief, weight control, medicines, surgery, and non-traditional treatment approaches. current treatments for osteoarthritis can relieve symptoms such as pain and disability, but right now there are no treatments that can cure osteoarthritis. exercise: one of the best treatments exercise is one of the best treatments for osteoarthritis. it can improve mood and outlook, decrease pain, increase flexibility, and help you maintain a healthy weight. the amount and form of exercise will depend on which joints are involved, how stable the joints are, whether or not the joint is swollen, and whether a joint replacement has already been done. ask your doctor or physical therapist what exercises are best for you the following types of exercise are part of a well-rounded arthritis treatment plan. - strengthening exercises. these exercises strengthen muscles that support joints affected by arthritis. they can be performed with weights or with exercise bands, inexpensive devices that add resistance. - aerobic activities. these are exercises, such as brisk walking or low-impact aerobics, that get your heart pumping and can keep your lungs and circulatory system in shape. - range-of-motion activities. these keep your joints limber. - balance and agility exercises. these help you maintain your balance and reduce the risk of falling. strengthening exercises. these exercises strengthen muscles that support joints affected by arthritis. they can be performed with weights or with exercise bands, inexpensive devices that add resistance. aerobic activities. these are exercises, such as brisk walking or low-impact aerobics, that get your heart pumping and can keep your lungs and circulatory system in shape. range-of-motion activities. these keep your joints limber. balance and agility exercises. these help you maintain your balance and reduce the risk of falling. to see examples of exercises for older adults, see exercises to try or visit go4life, the national institute on agings exercise and physical activity program for older adults. weight control if you are overweight or obese, you should try to lose weight. weight loss can reduce stress on weight-bearing joints, limit further injury, increase mobility, and reduce the risk of associated health problems. a dietitian can help you develop healthy eating habits. a healthy diet and regular exercise help reduce weight. rest and relief from stress on joints treatment plans include regularly scheduled rest. you must learn to recognize the bodys signals, and know when to stop or slow down. this will prevent the pain caused by overexertion. although pain can make it difficult to sleep, getting proper sleep is important for managing arthritis pain. if you have trouble sleeping, you may find that relaxation techniques, stress reduction, and biofeedback can help. timing medications to provide maximum pain relief through the night can also help. if joint pain interferes with your ability to sleep or rest, consult your doctor. some people find relief from special footwear and insoles that can reduce pain and improve walking or from using canes to take pressure off painful joints. they may use splints or braces to provide extra support for joints and/ or keep them in proper position during sleep or activity. splints should be used only for limited periods of time because joints and muscles need to be exercised to prevent stiffness and weakness. if you need a splint, an occupational therapist or a doctor can help you get a properly fitted one. non-drug pain relief and alternative therapies people with osteoarthritis may find many nondrug ways to relieve pain. below are some examples. - heat and cold. heat or cold (or a combination of the two) can be useful for joint pain. heat can be applied in a number of different ways -- with warm towels, hot packs, or a warm bath or shower -- to increase blood flow and ease pain and stiffness. in some cases, cold packs (bags of ice or frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel), which reduce inflammation, can relieve pain or numb the sore area.

removal of loose pieces of bone and cartilage from the joint if they are causing symptoms of buckling or locking (arthroscopic debridement). - repositioning of bones (osteotomy). - resurfacing (smoothing out) bones (joint resurfacing). removal of loose pieces of bone and cartilage from the joint if they are causing symptoms of buckling or locking (arthroscopic debridement). repositioning of bones (osteotomy). resurfacing (smoothing out) bones (joint resurfacing). joint replacement surgeons may replace affected joints with artificial joints called prostheses. these joints can be made from metal alloys, high-density plastic, and ceramic material. some prostheses are joined to bone surfaces with special cements. others have porous surfaces and rely on the growth of bone into that surface (a process called biologic fixation) to hold them in place. artificial joints can last 10 to 15 years or longer. surgeons choose the design and components of prostheses according to their patients weight, sex, age, activity level, and other medical conditions. joint replacement advances in recent years have included the ability, in some cases, to replace only the damaged part of the knee joint, leaving undamaged parts of the joint intact, and the ability to perform hip replacement through much smaller incisions than previously possible. for more on joint replacement see the hip replacement and knee replacement topics. deciding on surgery the decision to use surgery depends on several factors, including the patients age, occupation, level of disability, pain intensity, and the degree to which arthritis interferes with his or her lifestyle. after surgery and rehabilitation, the patient usually feels less pain and swelling and can move more easily."

what are the symptoms of problems with taste ?,"symptoms vary with disorders there are several types of taste disorders depending on how the sense of taste is affected. people who have taste disorders usually lose their ability to taste or can no longer perceive taste in the same way. true taste disorders are rare. most changes in the perception of food flavor result from the loss of smell. phantom taste perception. the most common taste complaint is ""phantom taste perception"" -- tasting something when nothing is in the mouth. hypogeusia. some people have hypogeusia, or the reduced ability to taste sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and savory, or umami. this disorder is usually temporary. dysgeusia. dysgeusia is a condition in which a foul, salty, rancid, or metallic taste sensation will persist in the mouth. dysgeusia is sometimes accompanied by burning mouth syndrome, a condition in which a person experiences a painful burning sensation in the mouth. although it can affect anyone, burning mouth syndrome is most common in middle-aged and older women. ageusia. other people can't detect taste at all, which is called ageusia. this type of taste disorder can be caused by head trauma; some surgical procedures, such as middle ear surgery or extraction of the third molar; radiation therapy; and viral infections. why a diagnosis is important if you think you have a taste disorder, see your doctor. loss of the sense of taste can lead to depression and a reduced desire to eat. loss of appetite can lead to loss of weight, poor nutrition and weakened immunity. in some cases, loss of taste can accompany or signal conditions such as diabetes. sometimes, a problem with taste can be a sign of a disease of the nervous system, such multiple sclerosis, alzheimer's disease, or parkinsons disease. do you have a taste disorder? if you think you have a taste disorder, try to identify and record the circumstances surrounding it. ask yourself the following questions: - when did i first become aware of it? - what changes in my taste do i notice? - do all foods and drinks taste the same? - have there been any changes in my sense of smell? - does the change in taste affect my ability to eat normally? - what medications do i take? what are the names of the medications? how much do i take? what is the health condition for which i take them? - have i recently had a cold or the flu? when did i first become aware of it? what changes in my taste do i notice? do all foods and drinks taste the same? have there been any changes in my sense of smell? does the change in taste affect my ability to eat normally? what medications do i take? what are the names of the medications? how much do i take? what is the health condition for which i take them? have i recently had a cold or the flu? talking with your doctor bring this information with you when you visit the doctor. he or she may refer you to an otolaryngologist, a specialist in diseases of the ear, nose, and throat. an accurate assessment of your taste loss will include, among other things - a physical examination of your ears, nose, and throat - a dental examination and assessment of oral hygiene - a review of your health history - a taste test supervised by a health care professional. a physical examination of your ears, nose, and throat a dental examination and assessment of oral hygiene a review of your health history a taste test supervised by a health care professional. tests for taste disorders some tests are designed to measure the lowest concentration of a substance that a person can detect or recognize. your doctor may ask you to compare the tastes of different substances or to note how the intensity of a taste grows when a substance's concentration is increased. scientists have developed taste tests in which the patient responds to different concentrations of a substance. this may involve a simple ""sip, spit, and rinse"" test or the application of a substance directly to your tongue using an eye dropper. by using these tests, your doctor can determine if you have a true taste disorder and what type it is. if your doctor suspects that nerves in your mouth or head may be affected, he or she may order an x-ray, usually a cat scan, to look further into the head and neck area. once the cause of a taste disorder is found, your doctor may be able to treat it. many types of taste disorders are reversible, but if not, counseling and self-help techniques may help you cope."

who is at risk for anxiety disorders? ?,"generalized anxiety disorder (gad) affects about 6.8 million american adults, including twice as many women as men. the disorder develops gradually and can begin at any point in the life cycle, although the years of highest risk are between childhood and middle age. the average age of onset is 31 years old. social phobia affects about 15 million american adults. women and men are equally likely to develop the disorder, which usually begins in childhood or early adolescence. there is some evidence that genetic factors are involved. panic disorder affects about 6 million american adults and is twice as common in women as men. panic attacks often begin in late adolescence or early adulthood, but not everyone who experiences panic attacks will develop panic disorder. many people have just one attack and never have another. the tendency to develop panic attacks appears to be inherited."
what is (are) diabetes ?,"too much glucose in the blood diabetes means your blood glucose (often called blood sugar) is too high. your blood always has some glucose in it because your body needs glucose for energy to keep you going. but too much glucose in the blood isn't good for your health. glucose comes from the food you eat and is also made in your liver and muscles. your blood carries the glucose to all of the cells in your body. insulin is a chemical (a hormone) made by the pancreas. the pancreas releases insulin into the blood. insulin helps the glucose from food get into your cells. if your body does not make enough insulin or if the insulin doesn't work the way it should, glucose can't get into your cells. it stays in your blood instead. your blood glucose level then gets too high, causing pre-diabetes or diabetes. types of diabetes there are three main kinds of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes. the result of type 1 and type 2 diabetes is the same: glucose builds up in the blood, while the cells are starved of energy. over the years, high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels, oftentimes leading to complications such as heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney disease, nerve problems, gum infections, and amputation. type 1 diabetes type 1 diabetes, which used to be called called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, develops most often in young people. however, type 1 diabetes can also develop in adults. with this form of diabetes, your body no longer makes insulin or doesnt make enough insulin because your immune system has attacked and destroyed the insulin-producing cells. about 5 to 10 percent of people with diabetes have type 1 diabetes. to survive, people with type 1 diabetes must have insulin delivered by injection or a pump. learn more about type 1 diabetes here. type 2 diabetes type 2 diabetes, which used to be called adult-onset diabetes or non insulin-dependent diabetes, is the most common form of diabetes. although people can develop type 2 diabetes at any age -- even during childhood -- type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people. type 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistancea condition that occurs when fat, muscle, and liver cells do not use insulin to carry glucose into the bodys cells to use for energy. as a result, the body needs more insulin to help glucose enter cells. at first, the pancreas keeps up with the added demand by making more insulin. over time, the pancreas doesnt make enough insulin when blood sugar levels increase, such as after meals. if your pancreas can no longer make enough insulin, you will need to treat your type 2 diabetes. learn more about type 2 diabetes here. gestational diabetes some women develop gestational diabetes during the late stages of pregnancy. gestational diabetes is caused by the hormones of pregnancy or a shortage of insulin. although this form of diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born, a woman who has had it and her child are more likely to develop diabetes later in life. prediabetes prediabetes means your blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. people with prediabetes are at an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes and for heart disease and stroke. the good news is that if you have prediabetes, you can reduce your risk of getting type 2 diabetes. with modest weight loss and moderate physical activity, you can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes. learn more about prediabetes here. signs of diabetes many people with diabetes experience one or more symptoms, including extreme thirst or hunger, a frequent need to urinate and/or fatigue. some lose weight without trying. additional signs include sores that heal slowly, dry, itchy skin, loss of feeling or tingling in the feet and blurry eyesight. some people with diabetes, however, have no symptoms at all. how many have diabetes? nearly 29 million americans age 20 or older (12.3 percent of all people in this age group) have diabetes, according to 2014 estimates from the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc). about 1.9 million people aged 20 years or older were newly diagnosed with diabetes in 2010 alone. people can get diabetes at any age, but the risk increases as we get older. in 2014, over 11 million older adults living in the u.s -- nearly 26 percent of people 65 or older -- had diabetes. see more statistics about diabetes from the national diabetes statistics report 2014. (centers for disease control and prevention.) if diabetes is not managed diabetes is a very serious disease. over time, diabetes that is not well managed causes serious damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, gums and teeth. if you have diabetes, you are more likely than people without diabetes to have heart disease or a stroke. people with diabetes also tend to develop heart disease or stroke at an earlier age than others. the best way to protect yourself from the serious complications of diabetes is to manage your blood glucose, blood pressure and cholesterol and to avoid smoking. it is not always easy, but people who make an ongoing effort to manage their diabetes can greatly improve their overall health."
who is at risk for diabetes? ?,"diabetes is a serious, life-long disease. it can lead to problems such as heart disease, stroke, vision loss, kidney disease, and nerve damage. more than 8 million people in the united states have type 2 diabetes and dont know it. many people dont find out they have diabetes until they are faced with problems such as blurry vision or heart trouble. certain factors can increase your risk for diabetes, and its important to know what they are. type 1 diabetes type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. in an autoimmune reaction, antibodies, or immune cells, attach to the bodys own healthy tissues by mistake, signaling the body to attack them. at present, scientists do not know exactly what causes the body's immune system to attack the cells, but many believe that both genetic factors and environmental factors, such as viruses, are involved. studies are now underway to identify these factors and prevent type 1 diabetes in people at risk. learn more about the causes of type 1 diabetes. type 2 diabetes type 2 diabetes -- the most common form -- is linked closely to overweight and obesity, high blood pressure, and abnormal cholesterol levels. many people with type 2 diabetes are overweight. being overweight can keep your body from using insulin properly. genes also play an important role in a person's risk for type 2 diabetes. having certain genes or combinations of genes may increase or decrease a persons risk for developing the disease. here are the risk factors for type 2 diabetes. - being over 45 years of age - being overweight or obese - having a first-degree relative -- a parent, brother, or sister -- with diabetes - being african american, american indian or alaska native, asian american or pacific islander, or hispanic american/latino.

how many people are affected by prostate cancer ?,"prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among american men. it is a slow-growing disease that mostly affects older men. in fact, more than 60 percent of all prostate cancers are found in men over the age of 65. the disease rarely occurs in men younger than 40 years of age."
how to diagnose prostate cancer ?,"doctors use tests to detect prostate abnormalities, but tests cannot show whether abnormalities are cancer or another, less serious condition. the results from these tests will help the doctor decide whether to check the patient further for signs of cancer. the most common test is a blood test for prostate specific antigen or psa -- a lab measures the levels of psa in a blood sample. the level of psa may rise in men who have prostate cancer, an enlarged prostate, or infection in the prostate."
how to diagnose prostate cancer ?,"the doctor may order other exams, including ultrasound, mri, or ct scans, to learn more about the cause of the symptoms. but to confirm the presence of cancer, doctors must perform a biopsy. during a biopsy, the doctor uses needles to remove small tissue samples from the prostate and then looks at the samples under a microscope. if a biopsy shows that cancer is present, the doctor will report on the grade of the tumor. doctors describe a tumor as low, medium, or high-grade cancer, based on the way it appears under the microscope."
what causes dry mouth ?,"people get dry mouth when the glands in the mouth that make saliva are not working properly. because of this, there might not be enough saliva to keep your mouth healthy. there are several reasons why these glands, called salivary glands, might not work right. medicines and dry mouth more than 400 medicines, including some over-the-counter medications, can cause the salivary glands to make less saliva, or to change the composition of the saliva so that it can't perform the functions it should. as an example, medicines for urinary incontinence, allergies, high blood pressure, and depression often cause dry mouth. diseases that can cause dry mouth some diseases can affect the salivary glands. dry mouth can occur in patients with diabetes. dry mouth is also the hallmark symptom of the fairly common autoimmune disease sjgren's syndrome. sjgren's syndrome can occur either by itself or with another autoimmune disease like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. salivary and tear glands are the major targets of the syndrome and the result is a decrease in production of saliva and tears. the disorder can occur at any age, but the average person with the disorder at the sjgren's syndrome clinic of the national institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr) is in his or her late 50s. women with the disorder outnumber men 9 to 1. cancer treatments and dry mouth certain cancer treatments can affect the salivary glands. head and neck radiation therapy can cause the glands to produce little or no saliva. chemotherapy may cause the salivary glands to produce thicker saliva, which makes the mouth feel dry and sticky. injury to the head or neck can damage the nerves that tell salivary glands to make saliva."
what causes dry mouth ?,"dry mouth can cause several problems, including difficulty tasting, chewing, swallowing, and speaking. swallowing may be especially difficult for those with too little saliva. for example, people with dry mouth may be unable to swallow dry food at all unless they also drink fluids with food. they also need to take small bites of food and be very aware of chewing and swallowing so they don't choke. dry mouth may also increase the chance of developing dental decay as well as oral fungal infections such as thrush, which causes painful white patches in the mouth."

how to diagnose osteoporosis ?,"who should be tested? the united states preventive service task force recommends that women aged 65 and older be screened (tested) for osteoporosis, as well as women aged 60 and older who are at increased risk for an osteoporosis-related fracture. however, the decision of whether or not to have a bone density test is best made between a patient and his or her physician. medicare will usually cover the cost of a bone density test, and a follow up test every 2 years, for female beneficiaries. it also will cover screening and follow up of any male medicare recipients who have significant risk factors for osteoporosis. when to talk with a doctor consider talking to your doctor about being evaluated for osteoporosis if - you are a man or woman over age 50 or a postmenopausal woman and you break a bone - you are a woman age 65 or older - you are a woman younger than 65 and at high risk for fractures - you have lost height, developed a stooped or hunched posture, or experienced sudden back pain with no apparent cause - you have been taking glucocorticoid medications such as prednisone, cortisone, or dexamethasone for 2 months or longer or are taking other medications known to cause bone loss - you have a chronic illness or are taking a medication that is known to cause bone loss - you have anorexia nervosa or a history of this eating disorder. - you are a premenopausal woman, not pregnant, and your menstrual periods have stopped, are irregular, or never started when you reached puberty. you are a man or woman over age 50 or a postmenopausal woman and you break a bone you are a woman age 65 or older you are a woman younger than 65 and at high risk for fractures you have lost height, developed a stooped or hunched posture, or experienced sudden back pain with no apparent cause you have been taking glucocorticoid medications such as prednisone, cortisone, or dexamethasone for 2 months or longer or are taking other medications known to cause bone loss you have a chronic illness or are taking a medication that is known to cause bone loss you have anorexia nervosa or a history of this eating disorder. you are a premenopausal woman, not pregnant, and your menstrual periods have stopped, are irregular, or never started when you reached puberty. diagnosing osteoporosis diagnosing osteoporosis involves several steps, starting with a physical exam and a careful medical history, blood and urine tests, and possibly a bone mineral density assessment. when recording information about your medical history, your doctor will ask questions to find out whether you have risk factors for osteoporosis and fractures. the doctor may ask about - any fractures you have had - your lifestyle (including diet, exercise habits, and whether you smoke) - current or past health problems - medications that could contribute to low bone mass and increased fracture risk - your family history of osteoporosis and other diseases - for women, your menstrual history. any fractures you have had your lifestyle (including diet, exercise habits, and whether you smoke) current or past health problems medications that could contribute to low bone mass and increased fracture risk your family history of osteoporosis and other diseases for women, your menstrual history. the doctor will also do a physical exam that should include checking for loss of height and changes in posture and may include checking your balance and gait (the way you walk). bone density tests the test used to diagnose osteoporosis is called a bone density test. this test is a measure of how strong -- or dense -- your bones are and can help your doctor predict your risk for having a fracture. bone density tests are painless, safe, and require no preparation on your part. bone density tests compare your bone density to the bones of an average healthy young adult. the test result, known as a t-score, tells you how strong your bones are, whether you have osteoporosis or osteopenia (low bone mass that is not low enough to be diagnosed as osteoporosis), and your risk for having a fracture. some bone density tests measure the strength of the hip, spine, and/or wrist, which are the bones that break most often in people with osteoporosis. other tests measure bone in the heel or hand. although no bone density test is 100 percent accurate, it is the single most important diagnostic test to predict whether a person will have a fracture in the future. the most widely recognized bone density test is a central dxa (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) scan of the hip and spine. this test shows if you have normal bone density, low bone mass, or osteoporosis. it is also used to monitor bone density changes as a person ages or in response to treatment."

what are the symptoms of alzheimer's disease ?,"alzheimer's disease varies from person to person so not everyone will have the same symptoms. also, the disease progresses faster in some people than in others. in general, though, alzheimers takes many years to develop and becomes increasingly severe over time. memory problems -- a common early sign memory problems are typically one of the first signs of alzheimers disease. however, not all memory problems are caused by alzheimers. if you or someone in your family thinks your forgetfulness is getting in the way of your normal routine, its time to see your doctor. he or she can find out whats causing these problems. a person in the early (mild) stage of alzheimers disease may - find it hard to remember things - ask the same questions over and over - get lost in familiar places - lose things or put them in odd places - have trouble handling money and paying bills - take longer than normal to finish daily tasks - have some mood and personality changes. find it hard to remember things ask the same questions over and over get lost in familiar places lose things or put them in odd places have trouble handling money and paying bills take longer than normal to finish daily tasks have some mood and personality changes. other thinking problems besides memory loss may be the first sign of alzheimers disease. a person may have - trouble finding the right words - vision and spatial issues - impaired reasoning or judgment. trouble finding the right words vision and spatial issues impaired reasoning or judgment. see a chart that compares signs of alzheimers disease with signs of normal aging. later signs of alzheimers as alzheimers disease progresses to the moderate stage, memory loss and confusion grow worse, and people may have problems recognizing family and friends. other symptoms at this stage may include - difficulty learning new things and coping with new situations - trouble carrying out tasks that involve multiple steps, like getting dressed - impulsive behavior - forgetting the names of common things - hallucinations, delusions, or paranoia - wandering away from home. difficulty learning new things and coping with new situations trouble carrying out tasks that involve multiple steps, like getting dressed impulsive behavior forgetting the names of common things hallucinations, delusions, or paranoia wandering away from home. symptoms of severe alzheimers as alzheimers disease becomes more severe, people lose the ability to communicate. they may sleep more, lose weight, and have trouble swallowing. often they are incontinentthey cannot control their bladder and/or bowels. eventually, they need total care. benefits of early diagnosis an early, accurate diagnosis of alzheimer's disease helps people and their families plan for the future. it gives them time to discuss care options, find support, and make legal and financial arrangements while the person with alzheimers can still take part in making decisions. also, even though no medicine or other treatment can stop or slow the disease, early diagnosis offers the best chance to treat the symptoms. how alzheimers is diagnosed the only definitive way to diagnose alzheimer's disease is to find out whether plaques and tangles exist in brain tissue. to look at brain tissue, doctors perform a brain autopsy, an examination of the brain done after a person dies. doctors can only make a diagnosis of ""possible"" or probable alzheimers disease while a person is alive. doctors with special training can diagnose alzheimer's disease correctly up to 90 percent of the time. doctors who can diagnose alzheimers include geriatricians, geriatric psychiatrists, and neurologists. a geriatrician specializes in the treatment of older adults. a geriatric psychiatrist specializes in mental problems in older adults. a neurologist specializes in brain and nervous system disorders. to diagnose alzheimers disease, doctors may - ask questions about overall health, past medical problems, ability to carry out daily activities, and changes in behavior and personality - conduct tests to measure memory, problem solving, attention, counting, and language skills - carry out standard medical tests, such as blood and urine tests - perform brain scans to look for anything in the brain that does not look normal. ask questions about overall health, past medical problems, ability to carry out daily activities, and changes in behavior and personality conduct tests to measure memory, problem solving, attention, counting, and language skills carry out standard medical tests, such as blood and urine tests perform brain scans to look for anything in the brain that does not look normal. test results can help doctors know if there are other possible causes of the person's symptoms. for example, thyroid problems, drug reactions, depression, brain tumors, head injury, and blood-vessel disease in the brain can cause symptoms similar to those of alzheimer's. many of these other conditions can be treated successfully. new diagnostic methods being studied researchers are exploring new ways to help doctors diagnose alzheimers disease earlier and more accurately. some studies focus on changes in a persons memory, language, and other mental functions. others look at changes in blood, spinal fluid, and brain-scan results that may detect alzheimers years before symptoms appear. watch a video that explains changes in diagnostic guidelines for alzheimers."
how to prevent alzheimer's disease ?,"currently, no medicines or other treatments are known to prevent alzheimers disease, but scientists are studying many possibilities. these possibilities include lifestyle factors such as exercise and physical activity, a healthy diet, and mentally stimulating activities. in addition to lifestyle factors, scientists have found clues that some long-term health conditions, like heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes, are related to alzheimer's disease. its possible that controlling these conditions will reduce the risk of developing alzheimers. exercise and physical activity studies show that exercise and other types of physical activity are good for our hearts, waistlines, and ability to carry out everyday activities. research suggests that exercise may also play a role in reducing risk for alzheimers disease. animal studies show that exercise increases both the number of small blood vessels that supply blood to the brain and the number of connections between nerve cells in older rats and mice. in addition, researchers have found that exercise raises the level of a nerve growth factor (a protein key to brain health) in an area of the brain that is important to memory and learning. see suggestions for ways older adults can start or continue to exercise. diet and dietary supplements a number of studies suggest that eating certain foods may help keep the brain healthyand that others can be harmful. a diet that includes lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and is low in fat and added sugar can reduce the risk of heart disease and diabetes. researchers are looking at whether a healthy diet also can help prevent alzheimers. one study reported that people who ate a mediterranean diet had a 28 percent lower risk of developing mci (mild cognitive impairment) and a 48 percent lower risk of progressing from mci to alzheimers disease. (mci often, but not always, leads to alzheimers dementia.) a mediterranean diet includes vegetables, legumes, fruits, cereals, fish, olive oil, and low amounts of saturated fats, dairy products, meat, and poultry. for more about healthy eating as you age , see eating well as you get older. other research has looked at the effect on brain health of several different vitamins and dietary supplements. one area of research focuses on antioxidants, natural substances that appear to fight damage caused by molecules called free radicals. other studies are looking at resveratrol, a compound found in red grapes and red wine, as well as vitamins and other substances found in food. chronic diseases age-related diseases and conditionssuch as vascular disease, high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetesmay increase the risk of alzheimers. many studies are looking at whether this risk can be reduced by preventing or controlling these diseases and conditions. for example, one clinical trial is looking at how lowering blood pressure to or below current recommended levels may affect cognitive decline and the development of mci and alzheimers disease. participants are older adults with high systolic (upper number) blood pressure who have a history of heart disease or stroke, or are at risk for those conditions. diabetes is another disease that has been linked to alzheimers. past research suggests that abnormal insulin production contributes to alzheimers-related brain changes. (insulin is the hormone involved in diabetes.) diabetes treatments have been tested in people with alzheimers, but the results have not been conclusive. keeping the brain active keeping the mind sharpthrough social engagement or intellectual stimulationis associated with a lower risk of alzheimers disease. activities like working, volunteering, reading, going to lectures, and playing computer and other games are being studied to see if they might help prevent alzheimers. one clinical trial is testing the impact of formal cognitive training, with and without physical exercise, in people with mci to see if it can prevent or delay alzheimers disease. other trials are underway in healthy older adults to see if exercise and/or cognitive training (for example, a demanding video game) can delay or prevent age-related cognitive decline. find out about things you can do that may keep your brain healthy."

what causes copd ?,"smoking most cases of copd develop over time, from breathing in fumes and other things that irritate the lungs. some of the things that put you at risk for copd include smoking, environmental exposure, and genetic factors. cigarette smoking is the most common cause of copd in the united states (either current or former smokers). pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoking can also cause copd, especially if the smoke is inhaled. environmental exposure copd can also occur in people who have had long-term exposure to things that can irritate your lungs, like chemical fumes, or dust from the environment or workplace. heavy or long-term exposure to secondhand smoke or other air pollutants may also contribute to copd even if you have never smoked or had long-term exposure to harmful pollutants. secondhand smoke is smoke in the air from other people smoking. genetic factors in a small number of people, copd is caused by a genetic condition known as alpha-1 antitrypsin, or aat, deficiency. people who have this condition have low levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin (aat)a protein made in the liver. having a low level of the aat protein can lead to lung damage and copd if you're exposed to smoke or other lung irritants. if you have this condition and smoke, copd can worsen very quickly. while very few people know if they have aat deficiency, it is estimated that about 1 in every 1,600 people to about 1 in every 5,000 people have it. people with aat deficiency can get copd even if they have never smoked or had long-term exposure to harmful pollutants. asthma although uncommon, some people who have asthma can develop copd. asthma is a chronic (long-term) lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. treatment usually can reverse the inflammation and narrowing. however, if not, copd can develop."
what causes copd ?,"copd is a disease that slowly worsens over time, especially if you continue to smoke. if you have copd, you are more likely to have lung infections, which can be fatal. if the lungs are severely damaged, the heart may be affected. a person with copd dies when the lungs and heart are unable to function and get oxygen to the body's organs and tissues, or when a complication, such as a severe infection, occurs. treatment for copd may help prevent complications, prolong life, and improve a person's quality of life."
what causes copd ?,"cigarette smoking is the most common cause of copd. most people with copd are smokers or have been smokers in the past. breathing in other fumes and dusts over long periods of time can also lead to copd. pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoking can cause copd, especially if the smoke is inhaled. exposure to secondhand smoke can play a role in causing copd. most people with copd are at least 40 years old or around middle age when symptoms start."

what are the symptoms of problems with smell ?,"a reduced sense of smell there are several types of smell disorders depending on how the sense of smell is affected. people who have smell disorders experience either a loss in their ability to smell or changes in the way they perceive odors. some people have hyposmia, which occurs when their ability to detect certain odors is reduced. this smell disorder is common in people who have upper respiratory infections or nasal congestion. this is usually temporary and goes away when the infection clears up. if you can't detect odor at all other people can't detect odor at all, which is called anosmia. this type of smell disorder is sometimes the result of head trauma in the nose region, usually from an automobile accident or chronic nasal or sinus infections. it can sometimes be caused by aging. in rare cases, anosmia is inherited. if your sense of smell is distorted sometimes a loss of smell can be accompanied by a change in the perception of odors. this type of smell disorder is called dysosmia. familiar odors may become distorted, or an odor that usually smells pleasant instead smells foul. sometimes people with this type of smell disorder also experience headaches, dizziness, shortness of breath, or anxiety. still others may perceive a smell that isn't present at all, which is called phantosmia. questions to ask yourself if you think you have a problem with your sense of smell, try to identify and record the circumstances at the time you first noticed the problem. ask yourself the following questions: - when did i first become aware of it? - did i have a cold or the flu? - did i have a head injury? - was i exposed to air pollutants, pollens, pet dander, or dust to which i might be allergic? - is this a recurring problem? - does it come at any special time, like during the hay fever season? when did i first become aware of it? did i have a cold or the flu? did i have a head injury? was i exposed to air pollutants, pollens, pet dander, or dust to which i might be allergic? is this a recurring problem? does it come at any special time, like during the hay fever season? bring this information with you when you visit your physician. also, be prepared to tell him or her about your general health and any medications you are taking. talking with your doctor diagnosis by a doctor is important to identify and treat the underlying cause of a potential smell disorder. your doctor may refer you to an otolaryngologist, a specialist in diseases of the ear, nose, and throat. an accurate assessment of a smell disorder will include, among other things, - a physical examination of the ears, nose, and throat - a review of your health history, such as exposure to toxic chemicals or injury, and - a smell test supervised by a health care professional. a physical examination of the ears, nose, and throat a review of your health history, such as exposure to toxic chemicals or injury, and a smell test supervised by a health care professional. tests for smell disorders some tests measure the smallest amount of odor you can detect. you also may receive a ""scratch and sniff"" test to determine how well you can identify various odors from a list of possibilities. in this test, the odor is embedded in a circular pad on a piece of paper and released when scratched. in this way, doctors can determine whether a person has a decreased ability to smell (hyposmia), the inability to detect any odors (anosmia), or another kind of smell disorder. in some cases, your doctor may need to perform a nasal examination with a nasal endoscope, an instrument that illuminates and magnifies the areas of the nose where the problem may exist. this test can help identify the area and extent of the problem and help your doctor select the right treatment. if your doctor suspects that upper regions of the nose and nasal sinuses that can't be seen by an endoscope are involved, he or she may order a specialized x-ray procedure, usually a ct scan, to look further into the nose and sinuses. when to see the doctor if you think you have a smell disorder, see your doctor. diagnosis of a smell disorder is important because once the cause is found, your doctor may be able to treat your smell disorder. many types of smell problems are reversible, but if they are not, counseling and self-help techniques may help you cope."
what are the treatments for problems with smell ?,"relief is possible although there is no treatment for presbyosmia -- loss of smell due to aging -- relief from smell disorders is possible for many older people. depending on the cause of your problem with smell, your doctor may be able to treat it or suggest ways to cope with it. recovering the ability to smell some people recover their ability to smell when they recover from the illness causing their loss of smell. some people recover their sense of smell spontaneously, for no obvious reason. other common causes of smell loss, such as the common cold or seasonal allergies, are usually temporary. smell is regained by waiting for the illness to run its course. in some cases, nasal obstructions, such as polyps, can be removed to restore airflow through the nasal passages and restore the sense of smell. if your smell disorder cant be successfully treated, you might want to seek counseling to help you adjust. ask about your medications sometimes a certain medication causes a smell disorder, and improvement occurs when the medicine causing the problem is stopped or changed. if you take medications, ask your doctor if they can affect your sense of smell. if so, ask if you could substitute other medications or reduce the dose. your doctor will work with you to get the medicine you need while trying to reduce unwanted side effects. medications that may help your doctor may suggest oral steroid medications such as prednisone, which is usually used for a short period of time, or topical steroid sprays, which can be used for longer periods of time. antibiotics are also used to treat nasal infections. the effectiveness of both steroids and antibiotics depends greatly on the severity and duration of the nasal swelling or infection. often relief is temporary. occasionally, the sense of smell returns to normal on its own without any treatment. steps you can take if you have a problem with smell, there are some things you can do. - wait it out. if you have had a cold with a stuffy nose, chances are in a few days your sense of smell will return. however, you should not wait to see your doctor if you think something more serious has caused your loss of smell or you have had the problem for a while. loss of smell can sometimes mean a more serious condition exists. wait it out. if you have had a cold with a stuffy nose, chances are in a few days your sense of smell will return. however, you should not wait to see your doctor if you think something more serious has caused your loss of smell or you have had the problem for a while. loss of smell can sometimes mean a more serious condition exists. - sweat it out. if your nose is stuffed up from a cold, sometimes mild exercise or the steam from a hot shower may open up your nasal passages. sweat it out. if your nose is stuffed up from a cold, sometimes mild exercise or the steam from a hot shower may open up your nasal passages. -

check with your doctor. if your sense of smell seems to have disappeared or changed, or if you've noticed the problem for a while, see your doctor for help. sometimes, especially with a sinus infection, taking antibiotics for a short period of time may remedy the problem. if there is a blockage or you have a chronic sinus condition, outpatient surgery may be called for. check with your doctor. if your sense of smell seems to have disappeared or changed, or if you've noticed the problem for a while, see your doctor for help. sometimes, especially with a sinus infection, taking antibiotics for a short period of time may remedy the problem. if there is a blockage or you have a chronic sinus condition, outpatient surgery may be called for. if your smell loss is permanent if you do not regain your sense of smell, there are things you should do to ensure your safety. take extra precautions to avoid eating food that may have spoiled. if you live with other people, ask them to smell the food to make sure it is fresh. people who live alone should discard food if there is a chance it is spoiled. other home safety measures include installing smoke alarms and gas detectors. for those who wish to have additional help, there may be support groups in your area. these are often associated with smell and taste clinics in medical school hospitals. some online bulletin boards also allow people with smell disorders to share their experiences. not all people with smell disorders will regain their sense of smell, but most can learn to live with it. ongoing research the national institute on deafness and other communication disorders (nidcd) supports basic and clinical investigations of smell and taste disorders at its laboratories in bethesda, md. and at universities and chemosensory research centers across the country. these chemosensory scientists are exploring how to - promote the regeneration of sensory nerve cells - understand the effects of the environment (such as gasoline fumes, chemicals, and extremes of humidity and temperature) on smell and taste - prevent the effects of aging on smell and taste - develop new diagnostic tests for taste and smell disorders - understand associations between smell disorders and changes in diet and food preferences in the elderly or among people with chronic illnesses. promote the regeneration of sensory nerve cells understand the effects of the environment (such as gasoline fumes, chemicals, and extremes of humidity and temperature) on smell and taste prevent the effects of aging on smell and taste develop new diagnostic tests for taste and smell disorders understand associations between smell disorders and changes in diet and food preferences in the elderly or among people with chronic illnesses."

who is at risk for creating a family health history? ?,"diseases can have various causes many things influence your overall health and likelihood of developing a disease. sometimes, it's not clear what causes a disease. many diseases are thought to be caused by a combination of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors. the importance of any particular factor varies from person to person. if you have a disease, does that mean your children and grandchildren will get it, too? not necessarily. they may have a greater chance of developing the disease than someone without a similar family history. but they are not certain to get the disease. (watch the video to learn more about why family health history is important. to enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. to reduce the video, press the escape (esc) button on your keyboard.) health problems that may run in families common health problems that can run in a family include: - alzheimer's disease/dementia - arthritis - asthma - blood clots - cancer - depression - diabetes - heart disease - high cholesterol - high blood pressure - pregnancy losses and birth defects - stroke. alzheimer's disease/dementia arthritis asthma blood clots cancer depression diabetes heart disease high cholesterol high blood pressure pregnancy losses and birth defects stroke. learn more about the importance of family history in some of these health problems at diseases, genetics and family history. (center for disease control and prevention) heritable diseases some diseases are clearly heritable. this means the disease comes from a mutation, or harmful change, in a gene inherited from one or both parents. genes are small structures in your body's cells that determine how you look and tell your body how to work. examples of heritable diseases are huntington's disease, cystic fibrosis, and muscular dystrophy. learn basic information about chromosomes. learn basic information about dna. role of lifestyle and environment genes are not the only things that cause disease. lifestyle habits and environment also play a major part in developing disease. diet, weight, physical activity, tobacco and alcohol use, occupation, and where you live can each increase or decrease disease risk. for example, smoking increases the chance of developing heart disease and cancer. for common diseases like heart disease and cancer, habits like smoking or drinking too much alcohol may be more important in causing disease than genes. sun exposure is the major known environmental factor associated with the development of skin cancer of all types. however, other environmental and genetic factors can also increase a persons risk. the best defense against skin cancer is to encourage sun-protective behaviors, regular skin examinations, and skin self-awareness in an effort to decrease high-risk behaviors and optimize early detection of problems. learn more about the causes and risk factors for skin cancer. clues to your disease risk creating a family health history helps you know about diseases and disease risks. it can also show the way a disease occurs in a family. for example, you may find that a family member had a certain disease at an earlier age than usual (10 to 20 years before most people get it). that can increase other family members' risk. risk also goes up if a relative has a disease that usually does not affect a certain gender, for example, breast cancer in a man. certain combinations of diseases within a family -- such as breast and ovarian cancer, or heart disease and diabetes -- also increase the chance of developing those diseases. some risk factors are not apparent even if they appear healthy, people could be at risk for developing a serious disease that runs in the family. they could have risk factors that they cannot feel, such as high blood pressure. they might not even know the disease runs in their family because they've lost touch with family members with the disease or because other family members with the disease have kept the information private. another possibility is that family members who might have developed the disease died young in accidents or by other means. they might also be adopted and not share genes with members of their adoptive family. getting professional advice family members who think they might be at risk for a disease based on their family health history can ask their health care professionals for advice. the professional may order a test to see if the person has the disease or a risk factor for the disease. for instance, a mammogram can detect possible breast cancer, and a colonoscopy can find colon cancer. many diseases are more treatable if they are caught early. the first step toward better understanding of your family's health is to learn more about the health of close relatives such as parents, brothers and sisters, and children. creating a family health history is one way to do that."

what research (or clinical trials) is being done for skin cancer ?,"many areas of research scientists are constantly searching for new ways to detect skin cancer, assess risk, and predict patient outcomes. they are interested in finding new treatments and new ways to deliver drugs and radiation. as scientists get a better understanding of what causes skin cancer and what genetic and environmental factors play a role, they should be able to design new drugs to hinder the development of cancer. clinical trials are designed to answer important questions and to find out whether new approaches are safe and effective. research has already led to advances, such as photodynamic therapy, and researchers continue to search for better ways to prevent and treat skin cancer. researching techniques to deliver drugs one area that scientists are working on is development of techniques for delivering chemotherapy drugs directly to the area around the tumor, rather than sending the chemotherapy through the entire body. one of these techniques is called hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion. hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion sends a warm solution containing anti-cancer drugs directly to the arm or leg in which the cancer is located. a tourniquet is used to temporarily cut off the blood flow while the chemotherapy drugs are injected directly into the limb. this allows the patient to receive a high dose of drugs only in the area where the cancer occurred. genetic research for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, researchers are studying gene changes that may be risk factors for the disease. they also are comparing combinations of biological therapy and surgery to treat basal cell cancer. discovering links between inherited genes, environmental factors, and skin cancer is another area of research that might provide scientists with insight they can use to screen people to determine their risk for the disease. recently, scientists at the national cancer institute (nci) found one genetic link that dramatically increases the chance of developing melanoma. research on melanoma treatments other studies are currently exploring new treatment options for melanoma. one recent study discovered a protein that may help block the development and spread of melanoma. this discovery could lead to a new treatment for melanoma patients in the future. several other studies are examining the potential for using vaccines to treat melanoma. an advance in treating melanoma in june of 2011, an important advance in treating melanoma was announced at an annual cancer meeting. a drug called ipilimumab was approved for treating the disease, and it works differently than traditional chemotherapy. it uses immunotherapy to help the immune system recognize and reject cancer cells. when its successful, immunotherapy can lead to complete reversal of even advanced disease. some patients with stage iv metastatic disease who were treated in early immunotherapy trials after other therapies were unsuccessful are still in complete remission more than 20 years later. vaccine research traditional vaccines are designed to prevent diseases in healthy people by teaching the body to recognize and attack a virus or bacteria it may encounter in the future. cancer vaccines, however, are given to people who already have cancer. these vaccines stimulate the immune system to fight against cancer by stopping its growth, shrinking a tumor, or killing the cancer cells that were not killed by other forms of treatment. developing a vaccine against a tumor such as melanoma is more complicated than developing a vaccine to fight a virus. clinical trials are in progress at the national cancer institute and other institutions to test the effectiveness of treating stage iii or stage iv melanoma patients with vaccines."

who is at risk for hairy cell leukemia? ?,gender and age may affect the risk of hairy cell leukemia. anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. the cause of hairy cell leukemia is unknown. it occurs more often in older men.
what are the stages of hairy cell leukemia ?,"key points - there is no standard staging system for hairy cell leukemia. there is no standard staging system for hairy cell leukemia. staging is the process used to find out how far the cancer has spread. groups are used in place of stages for hairy cell leukemia. the disease is grouped as untreated, progressive, or refractory. untreated hairy cell leukemia the hairy cell leukemia is newly diagnosed and has not been treated except to relieve signs or symptoms such as weight loss and infections. in untreated hairy cell leukemia, some or all of the following conditions occur: - hairy (leukemia) cells are found in the blood and bone marrow. - the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets may be lower than normal. - the spleen may be larger than normal. progressive hairy cell leukemia in progressive hairy cell leukemia, the leukemia has been treated with either chemotherapy or splenectomy (removal of the spleen) and one or both of the following conditions occur: - there is an increase in the number of hairy cells in the blood or bone marrow. - the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets in the blood is lower than normal."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for hairy cell leukemia ?,"new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials."
what are the stages of vulvar cancer ?,"key points - after vulvar cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the vulva or to other parts of the body. - there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - in vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (vin), abnormal cells are found on the surface of the vulvar skin. - the following stages are used for vulvar cancer: - stage i - stage ii - stage iii - stage iv after vulvar cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the vulva or to other parts of the body. the process used to find out if cancer has spread within the vulva or to other parts of the body is called staging. the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. the following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process: - pelvic exam : an exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum. a speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. a pap test of the cervix is usually done. the doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. the doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas. - colposcopy : a procedure in which a colposcope (a lighted, magnifying instrument) is used to check the vagina and cervix for abnormal areas. tissue samples may be taken using a curette (spoon-shaped instrument) or a brush and checked under a microscope for signs of disease. - cystoscopy : a procedure to look inside the bladder and urethra to check for abnormal areas. a cystoscope is inserted through the urethra into the bladder. a cystoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. it may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. - proctoscopy : a procedure to look inside the rectum and anus to check for abnormal areas. a proctoscope is inserted into the anus and rectum. a proctoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. it may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. - x-rays : an x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. to stage vulvar cancer, x-rays may be taken of the organs and bones inside the chest, and the pelvic bones. - intravenous pyelogram (ivp): a series of x-rays of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder to find out if cancer has spread to these organs. a contrast dye is injected into a vein. as the contrast dye moves through the kidneys, ureters and bladder, x-rays are taken to see if there are any blockages. this procedure is also called intravenous urography. - ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. - mri (magnetic resonance imaging): a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri). - pet scan (positron emission tomography scan): a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. - sentinel lymph node biopsy : the removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. the sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor. it is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor. a radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. the substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. the first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. if cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes. sentinel lymph node biopsy may be done during surgery to remove the tumor for early-stage vulvar cancer. there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: - tissue. the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. - lymph system. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. - blood. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. when cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. - lymph system. the cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. - blood. the cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. for example, if vulvar cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually vulvar cancer cells. the disease is metastatic vulvar cancer, not lung cancer. in vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (vin), abnormal cells are found on the surface of the vulvar skin. these abnormal cells are not cancer. vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (vin) may become cancer and spread into nearby tissue. vin is sometimes called stage 0 or carcinoma in situ. the following stages are used for vulvar cancer: stage i in stage i, cancer has formed. the tumor is found only in the vulva or perineum (area between the rectum and the vagina). stage i is divided into stages ia and ib. - in stage ia, the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller and has spread 1 millimeter or less into the tissue of the vulva. cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes. - in stage ib, the tumor is larger than 2 centimeters or has spread more than 1 millimeter into the tissue of the vulva. cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes. stage ii in stage ii, the tumor is any size and has spread into the lower part of the urethra, the lower part of the vagina, or the anus. cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes. stage iii in stage iii, the tumor is any size and may have spread into the lower part of the urethra, the lower part of the vagina, or the anus. cancer has spread to one or more nearby lymph nodes. stage iii is divided into stages iiia, iiib, and iiic. - in stage iiia, cancer is found in 1 or 2 lymph nodes that are smaller than 5 millimeters or in one lymph node that is 5 millimeters or larger. - in stage iiib, cancer is found in 2 or more lymph nodes that are 5 millimeters or larger, or in 3 or more lymph nodes that are smaller than 5 millimeters. - in stage iiic, cancer is found in lymph nodes and has spread to the outside surface of the lymph nodes. stage iv in stage iv, the tumor has spread into the upper part of the urethra, the upper part of the vagina, or to other parts of the body. stage iv is divided into stages iva and ivb. - in stage iva: - cancer has spread into the lining of the upper urethra, the upper vagina, the bladder, or the rectum, or has attached to the pelvic bone; or - cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes and the lymph nodes are not moveable or have formed an ulcer. - in stage ivb, cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis or to other parts of the body."
what are the treatments for gallbladder cancer ?,"key points - there are different types of treatment for patients with gallbladder cancer. - three types of standard treatment are used: - surgery - radiation therapy - chemotherapy - new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - radiation sensitizers - patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - follow-up tests may be needed. there are different types of treatment for patients with gallbladder cancer. different types of treatments are available for patients with gallbladder cancer. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. three types of standard treatment are used: surgery gallbladder cancer may be treated with a cholecystectomy, surgery to remove the gallbladder and some of the tissues around it. nearby lymph nodes may be removed. a laparoscope is sometimes used to guide gallbladder surgery. the laparoscope is attached to a video camera and inserted through an incision (port) in the abdomen. surgical instruments are inserted through other ports to perform the surgery. because there is a risk that gallbladder cancer cells may spread to these ports, tissue surrounding the port sites may also be removed. if the cancer has spread and cannot be removed, the following types of palliative surgery may relieve symptoms: - surgical biliary bypass: if the tumor is blocking the small intestine and bile is building up in the gallbladder, a biliary bypass may be done. during this operation, the gallbladder or bile duct will be cut and sewn to the small intestine to create a new pathway around the blocked area. - endoscopic stent placement: if the tumor is blocking the bile duct, surgery may be done to put in a stent (a thin, flexible tube) to drain bile that has built up in the area. the stent may be placed through a catheter that drains to the outside of the body or the stent may go around the blocked area and drain the bile into the small intestine. - percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage: a procedure done to drain bile when there is a blockage and endoscopic stent placement is not possible. an x-ray of the liver and bile ducts is done to locate the blockage. images made by ultrasound are used to guide placement of a stent, which is left in the liver to drain bile into the small intestine or a collection bag outside the body. this procedure may be done to relieve jaundice before surgery. radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy: - external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. - internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. external radiation therapy is used to treat gallbladder cancer. chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. it may not mention every new treatment being studied. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. radiation sensitizers clinical trials are studying ways to improve the effect of radiation therapy on tumor cells, including the following: - hyperthermia therapy: a treatment in which body tissue is exposed to high temperatures to damage and kill cancer cells or to make cancer cells more sensitive to the effects of radiation therapy and certain anticancer drugs. - radiosensitizers: drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. giving radiation therapy together with radiosensitizers may kill more tumor cells. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials. follow-up tests may be needed. some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. treatment options for gallbladder cancer localized gallbladder cancer treatment of localized gallbladder cancer may include the following: - surgery to remove the gallbladder and some of the tissue around it. part of the liver and nearby lymph nodes may also be removed. radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy may follow surgery. - radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy. - a clinical trial of radiation therapy with radiosensitizers. check the list of nci-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with localized gallbladder cancer. for more specific results, refine the search by using other search features, such as the location of the trial, the type of treatment, or the name of the drug. talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you. general information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic gallbladder cancer treatment of unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic gallbladder cancer is usually within a clinical trial. treatment may include the following: - percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage or the placement of stents to relieve symptoms caused by blocked bile ducts. this may be followed by radiation therapy as palliative treatment. - surgery as palliative treatment to relieve symptoms caused by blocked bile ducts. - chemotherapy. - a clinical trial of new ways to give palliative radiation therapy, such as giving it together with hyperthermia therapy, radiosensitizers, or chemotherapy. - a clinical trial of new drugs and drug combinations. check the list of nci-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with unresectable gallbladder cancer, recurrent gallbladder cancer and metastatic gallbladder cancer. for more specific results, refine the search by using other search features, such as the location of the trial, the type of treatment, or the name of the drug. talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you. general information about clinical trials is available from the nci website."

what research (or clinical trials) is being done for skin cancer ?,"cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer. cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer. the purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. these may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements. new ways to prevent skin cancer are being studied in clinical trials. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. information about clinical trials can be found in the clinical trials section of the nci web site. check nci's list of cancer clinical trials for nonmelanoma skin cancer prevention trials and melanoma prevention trials that are now accepting patients."
what is (are) adult acute myeloid leukemia ?,"key points - adult acute myeloid leukemia (aml) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or platelets. - leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. - there are different subtypes of aml. - smoking, previous chemotherapy treatment, and exposure to radiation may affect the risk of adult aml. - signs and symptoms of adult aml include fever, feeling tired, and easy bruising or bleeding. - tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect (find) and diagnose adult aml. - certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. adult acute myeloid leukemia (aml) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or platelets. adult acute myeloid leukemia (aml) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. this type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated. it is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. aml is also called acute myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, acute granulocytic leukemia, and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. normally, the bone marrow makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time. a blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell. a lymphoid stem cell becomes a white blood cell. a myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells: - red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body. - white blood cells that fight infection and disease. - platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding. in aml, the myeloid stem cells usually become a type of immature white blood cell called myeloblasts (or myeloid blasts). the myeloblasts in aml are abnormal and do not become healthy white blood cells. sometimes in aml, too many stem cells become abnormal red blood cells or platelets. these abnormal white blood cells, red blood cells, or platelets are also called leukemia cells or blasts. leukemia cells can build up in the bone marrow and blood so there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. when this happens, infection, anemia, or easy bleeding may occur. the leukemia cells can spread outside the blood to other parts of the body, including the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), skin, and gums. this summary is about adult aml. see the following pdq summaries for information about other types of leukemia: - childhood acute myeloid leukemia/other myeloid malignancies treatment - chronic myelogenous leukemia treatment - adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment - childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment - chronic lymphocytic leukemia treatment - hairy cell leukemia treatment there are different subtypes of aml. most aml subtypes are based on how mature (developed) the cancer cells are at the time of diagnosis and how different they are from normal cells. acute promyelocytic leukemia (apl) is a subtype of aml that occurs when parts of two genes stick together. apl usually occurs in middle-aged adults. signs of apl may include both bleeding and forming blood clots."
who is at risk for adult acute myeloid leukemia? ?,"smoking, previous chemotherapy treatment, and exposure to radiation may affect the risk of adult aml. anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. possible risk factors for aml include the following: - being male. - smoking, especially after age 60. - having had treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy in the past. - having had treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) in the past. - being exposed to radiation from an atomic bomb or to the chemical benzene. - having a history of a blood disorder such as myelodysplastic syndrome."

signs of childhood extracranial germ cell tumors depend on the type of tumor and where it is in the body. - imaging studies and blood tests are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood extracranial germ cell tumors. - certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. childhood extracranial germ cell tumors form from germ cells in parts of the body other than the brain. a germ cell is a type of cell that forms as a fetus (unborn baby) develops. these cells later become sperm in the testicles or eggs in the ovaries. sometimes while the fetus is forming, germ cells travel to parts of the body where they should not be and grow into a germ cell tumor. the tumor may form before or after birth. this summary is about germ cell tumors that form in parts of the body that are extracranial (outside the brain). extracranial germ cell tumors usually form in the following areas of the body: - testicles. - ovaries. - sacrum or coccyx (bottom part of the spine). - retroperitoneum (the back wall of the abdomen). - mediastinum (area between the lungs). extracranial germ cell tumors are most common in adolescents 15 to 19 years of age. see the pdq summary on childhood central nervous system germ cell tumors treatment for information on intracranial (inside the brain) germ cell tumors. childhood extracranial germ cell tumors may be benign or malignant. extracranial germ cell tumors may be benign (noncancer) or malignant (cancer). there are three types of extracranial germ cell tumors. extracranial germ cell tumors are grouped into mature teratomas, immature teratomas, and malignant germ cell tumors: mature teratomas mature teratomas are the most common type of extracranial germ cell tumor. mature teratomas are benign tumors and not likely to become cancer. they usually occur in the sacrum or coccyx (bottom part of the spine) in newborns or in the ovaries of girls at the start of puberty. the cells of mature teratomas look almost like normal cells under a microscope. some mature teratomas release enzymes or hormones that cause signs and symptoms of disease. immature teratomas immature teratomas also usually occur in the sacrum or coccyx (bottom part of the spine) in newborns or the ovaries of girls at the start of puberty. immature teratomas have cells that look very different from normal cells under a microscope. immature teratomas may be cancer. they often have several different types of tissue in them, such as hair, muscle, and bone. some immature teratomas release enzymes or hormones that cause signs and symptoms of disease. malignant germ cell tumors malignant germ cell tumors are cancer. there are two main types of malignant germ cell tumors: - germinomas: tumors that make a hormone called beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hcg). there are three types of germinomas. - dysgerminomas form in the ovary in girls. - seminomas form in the testicle in boys. - germinomas form in areas of the body that are not the ovary or testicle. - nongerminomas: there are four types of nongerminomas. - yolk sac tumors make a hormone called alpha-fetoprotein (afp). they can form in the ovary, testicle, or other areas of the body. - choriocarcinomas make a hormone called beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hcg). they can form in the ovary, testicle, or other areas of the body. - embryonal carcinomas may make a hormone called -hcg and/or a hormone called afp. they can form in the testicle or other parts of the body, but not in the ovary. - mixed germ cell tumors are made up of both malignant germ cell tumor and teratoma. they can form in the ovary, testicle, or other areas of the body. childhood extracranial germ cell tumors are grouped as gonadal or extragonadal. malignant extracranial germ cell tumors are gonadal or extragonadal. gonadal germ cell tumors gonadal germ cell tumors form in the testicles in boys or ovaries in girls. testicular germ cell tumors testicular germ cell tumors are divided into two main types, seminoma and nonseminoma. - seminomas make a hormone called beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hcg). - nonseminomas are usually large and cause signs or symptoms. they tend to grow and spread more quickly than seminomas. testicular germ cell tumors usually occur before the age of 4 years or in adolescents and young adults. testicular germ cell tumors in adolescents and young adults are different from those that form in early childhood. boys older than 14 years with testicular germ cell tumors are treated in pediatric cancer centers, but the treatment is much like the treatment used in adults. (see the pdq summary on testicular cancer treatment for more information.) ovarian germ cell tumors ovarian germ cell tumors are more common in adolescent girls and young women. most ovarian germ cell tumors are benign teratomas. sometimes immature teratomas, dysgerminomas, yolk sac tumors, and mixed germ cell tumors (cancer) occur. (see the pdq summary on ovarian germ cell tumors treatment for more information.) extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors form in areas other than the brain, testicles, or ovaries. most extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors form along the midline of the body. this includes the following: - sacrum (the large, triangle-shaped bone in the lower spine that forms part of the pelvis). - coccyx (the small bone at the bottom of the spine, also called the tailbone). - mediastinum (the area between the lungs). - back of the abdomen. - neck. in younger children, extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors usually occur at birth or in early childhood. most of these tumors are teratomas in the sacrum or coccyx. in older children, adolescents, and young adults, extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors are often in the mediastinum."
who is at risk for uterine sarcoma? ?,"being exposed to x-rays can increase the risk of uterine sarcoma. anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. risk factors for uterine sarcoma include the following: - past treatment with radiation therapy to the pelvis. - treatment with tamoxifen for breast cancer. if you are taking this drug, have a pelvic exam every year and report any vaginal bleeding (other than menstrual bleeding) as soon as possible."
what are the stages of uterine sarcoma ?,"key points - after uterine sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body. - uterine sarcoma may be diagnosed, staged, and treated in the same surgery. - there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - the following stages are used for uterine sarcoma: - stage i - stage ii - stage iii - stage iv after uterine sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body. the process used to find out if cancer has spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body is called staging. the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. the following procedures may be used in the staging process: - blood chemistry studies : a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. an unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. - ca 125 assay : a test that measures the level of ca 125 in the blood. ca 125 is a substance released by cells into the bloodstream. an increased ca 125 level is sometimes a sign of cancer or other condition. - chest x-ray : an x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. an x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. - transvaginal ultrasound exam: a procedure used to examine the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and bladder. an ultrasound transducer (probe) is inserted into the vagina and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. the doctor can identify tumors by looking at the sonogram. - ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen and pelvis, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues to show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. - cystoscopy : a procedure to look inside the bladder and urethra to check for abnormal areas. a cystoscope is inserted through the urethra into the bladder. a cystoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. it may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. uterine sarcoma may be diagnosed, staged, and treated in the same surgery. surgery is used to diagnose, stage, and treat uterine sarcoma. during this surgery, the doctor removes as much of the cancer as possible. the following procedures may be used to diagnose, stage, and treat uterine sarcoma: - laparotomy: a surgical procedure in which an incision (cut) is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease. the size of the incision depends on the reason the laparotomy is being done. sometimes organs are removed or tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease. - abdominal and pelvic washings: a procedure in which a saline solution is placed into the abdominal and pelvic body cavities. after a short time, the fluid is removed and viewed under a microscope to check for cancer cells. - total abdominal hysterectomy: a surgical procedure to remove the uterus and cervix through a large incision (cut) in the abdomen. - bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: surgery to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes. - lymphadenectomy: a surgical procedure in which lymph nodes are removed and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. for a regional lymphadenectomy, some of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed. for a radical lymphadenectomy, most or all of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed. this procedure is also called lymph node dissection. treatment in addition to surgery may be given, as described in the treatment option overview section of this summary. there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: - tissue. the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. - lymph system. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. - blood. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. when cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. - lymph system. the cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. - blood. the cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. for example, if uterine sarcoma spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually uterine sarcoma cells. the disease is metastatic uterine sarcoma, not lung cancer. the following stages are used for uterine sarcoma: stage i in stage i, cancer is found in the uterus only. stage i is divided into stages ia and ib, based on how far the cancer has spread. - stage ia: cancer is in the endometrium only or less than halfway through the myometrium (muscle layer of the uterus). - stage ib: cancer has spread halfway or more into the myometrium. stage ii in stage ii, cancer has spread into connective tissue of the cervix, but has not spread outside the uterus. stage iii in stage iii, cancer has spread beyond the uterus and cervix, but has not spread beyond the pelvis. stage iii is divided into stages iiia, iiib, and iiic, based on how far the cancer has spread within the pelvis. - stage iiia: cancer has spread to the outer layer of the uterus and/or to the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and ligaments of the uterus. - stage iiib: cancer has spread to the vagina or to the parametrium (connective tissue and fat around the uterus). - stage iiic: cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis and/or around the aorta (largest artery in the body, which carries blood away from the heart). stage iv in stage iv, cancer has spread beyond the pelvis. stage iv is divided into stages iva and ivb, based on how far the cancer has spread. - stage iva: cancer has spread to the bladder and/or bowel wall. - stage ivb: cancer has spread to other parts of the body beyond the pelvis, including the abdomen and/or lymph nodes in the groin."
how to diagnose chronic myelogenous leukemia ?,"tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect (find) and diagnose chronic myelogenous leukemia. the following tests and procedures may be used: - physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease such as an enlarged spleen. a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. - complete blood count (cbc) with differential : a procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following: - the number of red blood cells and platelets. - the number and type of white blood cells. - the amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells. - the portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells. - blood chemistry studies : a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. an unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. - bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : the removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a needle into the hipbone or breastbone. a pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for abnormal cells. one of the following tests may be done on the samples of blood or bone marrow tissue that are removed: - cytogenetic analysis: a test in which cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes, such as the philadelphia chromosome. - fish (fluorescence in situ hybridization): a laboratory technique used to look at genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues. pieces of dna that contain a fluorescent dye are made in the laboratory and added to cells or tissues on a glass slide. when these pieces of dna bind to specific genes or areas of chromosomes on the slide, they light up when viewed under a microscope with a special light. - reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (rtpcr): a laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are studied using chemicals to look for certain changes in the structure or function of genes."
what is the outlook for chronic myelogenous leukemia ?,certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following: - the patients age. - the phase of cml. - the amount of blasts in the blood or bone marrow. - the size of the spleen at diagnosis. - the patients general health.
what are the stages of chronic myelogenous leukemia ?,"key points - after chronic myelogenous leukemia has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread. - chronic myelogenous leukemia has 3 phases. - chronic phase - accelerated phase - blastic phase after chronic myelogenous leukemia has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread. staging is the process used to find out how far the cancer has spread. there is no standard staging system for chronic myelogenous leukemia (cml). instead, the disease is classified by phase: chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blastic phase. it is important to know the phase in order to plan treatment. the information from tests and procedures done to detect (find) and diagnose chronic myelogenous leukemia is also used to plan treatment. chronic myelogenous leukemia has 3 phases. as the amount of blast cells increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. this may result in infections, anemia, and easy bleeding, as well as bone pain and pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs on the left side. the number of blast cells in the blood and bone marrow and the severity of signs or symptoms determine the phase of the disease. chronic phase in chronic phase cml, fewer than 10% of the cells in the blood and bone marrow are blast cells. accelerated phase in accelerated phase cml, 10% to 19% of the cells in the blood and bone marrow are blast cells. blastic phase in blastic phase cml, 20% or more of the cells in the blood or bone marrow are blast cells. when tiredness, fever, and an enlarged spleen occur during the blastic phase, it is called blast crisis."
what are the symptoms of merkel cell carcinoma ?,merkel cell carcinoma usually appears as a single painless lump on sun-exposed skin. this and other changes in the skin may be caused by merkel cell carcinoma or by other conditions. check with your doctor if you see changes in your skin. merkel cell carcinoma usually appears on sun-exposed skin as a single lump that is: - fast-growing. - painless. - firm and dome-shaped or raised. - red or violet in color.
who is at risk for extragonadal germ cell tumors? ?,age and gender can affect the risk of extragonadal germ cell tumors. anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. risk factors for malignant extragonadal germ cell tumors include the following: - being male. - being age 20 or older. - having klinefelter syndrome.
what are the treatments for renal cell cancer ?,"key points - there are different types of treatment for patients with renal cell cancer. - five types of standard treatment are used: - surgery - radiation therapy - chemotherapy - biologic therapy - targeted therapy - new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - follow-up tests may be needed. there are different types of treatment for patients with renal cell cancer. different types of treatments are available for patients with renal cell cancer. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. five types of standard treatment are used: surgery surgery to remove part or all of the kidney is often used to treat renal cell cancer. the following types of surgery may be used: - partial nephrectomy: a surgical procedure to remove the cancer within the kidney and some of the tissue around it. a partial nephrectomy may be done to prevent loss of kidney function when the other kidney is damaged or has already been removed. - simple nephrectomy: a surgical procedure to remove the kidney only. - radical nephrectomy: a surgical procedure to remove the kidney, the adrenal gland, surrounding tissue, and, usually, nearby lymph nodes. a person can live with part of 1 working kidney, but if both kidneys are removed or not working, the person will need dialysis (a procedure to clean the blood using a machine outside of the body) or a kidney transplant (replacement with a healthy donated kidney). a kidney transplant may be done when the disease is in the kidney only and a donated kidney can be found. if the patient has to wait for a donated kidney, other treatment is given as needed. when surgery to remove the cancer is not possible, a treatment called arterial embolization may be used to shrink the tumor. a small incision is made and a catheter (thin tube) is inserted into the main blood vessel that flows to the kidney. small pieces of a special gelatin sponge are injected through the catheter into the blood vessel. the sponges block the blood flow to the kidney and prevent the cancer cells from getting oxygen and other substances they need to grow. even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy: - external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. - internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. external radiation therapy is used to treat renal cell cancer, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. see drugs approved for kidney (renal cell) cancer for more information. biologic therapy biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer. substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer. this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy. the following types of biologic therapy are being used or studied in the treatment of renal cell cancer: - nivolumab: nivolumab is a monoclonal antibody that boosts the bodys immune response against renal cell cancer cells. - interferon: interferon affects the division of cancer cells and can slow tumor growth. - interleukin-2 (il-2): il-2 boosts the growth and activity of many immune cells, especially lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). lymphocytes can attack and kill cancer cells. see drugs approved for kidney (renal cell) cancer for more information. targeted therapy targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. targeted therapy with antiangiogenic agents are used to treat advanced renal cell cancer. antiangiogenic agents keep blood vessels from forming in a tumor, causing the tumor to starve and stop growing or to shrink. monoclonal antibodies and kinase inhibitors are two types of antiangiogenic agents used to treat renal cell cancer. monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory, from a single type of immune system cell. these antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. the antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. they may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. monoclonal antibodies used to treat renal cell cancer attach to and block substances that cause new blood vessels to form in tumors. kinase inhibitors stop cells from dividing and may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. an mtor inhibitor is a type of kinase inhibitor. everolimus and temsirolimus are mtor inhibitors used to treat advanced renal cell cancer. see drugs approved for kidney (renal cell) cancer for more information. new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials. follow-up tests may be needed. some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. treatment options for renal cell cancer stage i renal cell cancer treatment of stage i renal cell cancer may include the following: -

how to diagnose colon cancer ?,"tests that examine the colon and rectum are used to detect (find) and diagnose colon cancer. the following tests and procedures may be used: - physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. - digital rectal exam : an exam of the rectum. the doctor or nurse inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or anything else that seems unusual. - fecal occult blood test (fobt): a test to check stool (solid waste) for blood that can only be seen with a microscope. a small sample of stool is placed on a special card or in a special container and returned to the doctor or laboratory for testing. blood in the stool may be a sign of polyps, cancer, or other conditions. there are two types of fobts: - guaiac fobt : the sample of stool on the special card is tested with a chemical. if there is blood in the stool, the special card changes color. - immunochemical fobt : a liquid is added to the stool sample. this mixture is injected into a machine that contains antibodies that can detect blood in the stool. if there is blood in the stool, a line appears in a window in the machine. this test is also called fecal immunochemical test or fit. - barium enema : a series of x-rays of the lower gastrointestinal tract. a liquid that contains barium (a silver-white metallic compound) is put into the rectum. the barium coats the lower gastrointestinal tract and x-rays are taken. this procedure is also called a lower gi series. - sigmoidoscopy : a procedure to look inside the rectum and sigmoid (lower) colon for polyps (small areas of bulging tissue), other abnormal areas, or cancer. a sigmoidoscope is inserted through the rectum into the sigmoid colon. a sigmoidoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. it may also have a tool to remove polyps or tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. - colonoscopy : a procedure to look inside the rectum and colon for polyps, abnormal areas, or cancer. a colonoscope is inserted through the rectum into the colon. a colonoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. it may also have a tool to remove polyps or tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. - virtual colonoscopy : a procedure that uses a series of x-rays called computed tomography to make a series of pictures of the colon. a computer puts the pictures together to create detailed images that may show polyps and anything else that seems unusual on the inside surface of the colon. this test is also called colonography or ct colonography. - biopsy : the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer."
what are the stages of colon cancer ?,"key points - after colon cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the colon or to other parts of the body. - there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - the following stages are used for colon cancer: - stage 0 (carcinoma in situ) - stage i - stage ii - stage iii - stage iv after colon cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the colon or to other parts of the body. the process used to find out if cancer has spread within the colon or to other parts of the body is called staging. the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. the following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process: - ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen or chest, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. - mri (magnetic resonance imaging): a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the colon. a substance called gadolinium is injected into the patient through a vein. the gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri). - pet scan (positron emission tomography scan): a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. - chest x-ray : an x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. an x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. - surgery : a procedure to remove the tumor and see how far it has spread through the colon. - lymph node biopsy : the removal of all or part of a lymph node. a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. - complete blood count (cbc): a procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following: - the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. - the amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells. - the portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells. - carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) assay : a test that measures the level of cea in the blood. cea is released into the bloodstream from both cancer cells and normal cells. when found in higher than normal amounts, it can be a sign of colon cancer or other conditions. there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: - tissue. the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. - lymph system. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. - blood. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. when cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. - lymph system. the cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. - blood. the cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. for example, if colon cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually colon cancer cells. the disease is metastatic colon cancer, not lung cancer. the following stages are used for colon cancer: stage 0 (carcinoma in situ) in stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the mucosa (innermost layer) of the colon wall. these abnormal cells may become cancer and spread. stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ. stage i in stage i, cancer has formed in the mucosa (innermost layer) of the colon wall and has spread to the submucosa (layer of tissue under the mucosa). cancer may have spread to the muscle layer of the colon wall. stage ii stage ii colon cancer is divided into stage iia, stage iib, and stage iic. - stage iia: cancer has spread through the muscle layer of the colon wall to the serosa (outermost layer) of the colon wall. - stage iib: cancer has spread through the serosa (outermost layer) of the colon wall but has not spread to nearby organs. - stage iic: cancer has spread through the serosa (outermost layer) of the colon wall to nearby organs. stage iii stage iii colon cancer is divided into stage iiia, stage iiib, and stage iiic. in stage iiia: - cancer has spread through the mucosa (innermost layer) of the colon wall to the submucosa (layer of tissue under the mucosa) and may have spread to the muscle layer of the colon wall. cancer has spread to at least one but not more than 3 nearby lymph nodes or cancer cells have formed in tissues near the lymph nodes; or - cancer has spread through the mucosa (innermost layer) of the colon wall to the submucosa (layer of tissue under the mucosa). cancer has spread to at least 4 but not more than 6 nearby lymph nodes. in stage iiib: - cancer has spread through the muscle layer of the colon wall to the serosa (outermost layer) of the colon wall or has spread through the serosa but not to nearby organs. cancer has spread to at least one but not more than 3 nearby lymph nodes or cancer cells have formed in tissues near the lymph nodes; or - cancer has spread to the muscle layer of the colon wall or to the serosa (outermost layer) of the colon wall. cancer has spread to at least 4 but not more than 6 nearby lymph nodes; or - cancer has spread through the mucosa (innermost layer) of the colon wall to the submucosa (layer of tissue under the mucosa) and may have spread to the muscle layer of the colon wall. cancer has spread to 7 or more nearby lymph nodes. in stage iiic: - cancer has spread through the serosa (outermost layer) of the colon wall but has not spread to nearby organs. cancer has spread to at least 4 but not more than 6 nearby lymph nodes; or - cancer has spread through the muscle layer of the colon wall to the serosa (outermost layer) of the colon wall or has spread through the serosa but has not spread to nearby organs. cancer has spread to 7 or more nearby lymph nodes; or - cancer has spread through the serosa (outermost layer) of the colon wall and has spread to nearby organs. cancer has spread to one or more nearby lymph nodes or cancer cells have formed in tissues near the lymph nodes. stage iv stage iv colon cancer is divided into stage iva and stage ivb. - stage iva: cancer may have spread through the colon wall and may have spread to nearby organs or lymph nodes. cancer has spread to one organ that is not near the colon, such as the liver, lung, or ovary, or to a distant lymph node. - stage ivb: cancer may have spread through the colon wall and may have spread to nearby organs or lymph nodes. cancer has spread to more than one organ that is not near the colon or into the lining of the abdominal wall."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for colon cancer ?,"new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials."
how to diagnose intraocular (uveal) melanoma ?,"tests that examine the eye are used to help detect (find) and diagnose intraocular melanoma. the following tests and procedures may be used: - physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. - eye exam with dilated pupil: an exam of the eye in which the pupil is dilated (enlarged) with medicated eye drops to allow the doctor to look through the lens and pupil to the retina. the inside of the eye, including the retina and the optic nerve, is checked. pictures may be taken over time to keep track of changes in the size of the tumor. there are several types of eye exams: - ophthalmoscopy : an exam of the inside of the back of the eye to check the retina and optic nerve using a small magnifying lens and a light. - slit-lamp biomicroscopy : an exam of the inside of the eye to check the retina, optic nerve, and other parts of the eye using a strong beam of light and a microscope. - gonioscopy : an exam of the front part of the eye between the cornea and iris. a special instrument is used to see if the area where fluid drains out of the eye is blocked. - ultrasound exam of the eye: a procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off the internal tissues of the eye to make echoes. eye drops are used to numb the eye and a small probe that sends and receives sound waves is placed gently on the surface of the eye. the echoes make a picture of the inside of the eye and the distance from the cornea to the retina is measured. the picture, called a sonogram, shows on the screen of the ultrasound monitor. - high-resolution ultrasound biomicroscopy : a procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off the internal tissues of the eye to make echoes. eye drops are used to numb the eye and a small probe that sends and receives sound waves is placed gently on the surface of the eye. the echoes make a more detailed picture of the inside of the eye than a regular ultrasound. the tumor is checked for its size, shape, and thickness, and for signs that the tumor has spread to nearby tissue. - transillumination of the globe and iris: an exam of the iris, cornea, lens, and ciliary body with a light placed on either the upper or lower lid. - fluorescein angiography : a procedure to look at blood vessels and the flow of blood inside the eye. an orange fluorescent dye (fluorescein) is injected into a blood vessel in the arm and goes into the bloodstream. as the dye travels through blood vessels of the eye, a special camera takes pictures of the retina and choroid to find any areas that are blocked or leaking. - indocyanine green angiography: a procedure to look at blood vessels in the choroid layer of the eye. a green dye (indocyanine green) is injected into a blood vessel in the arm and goes into the bloodstream. as the dye travels through blood vessels of the eye, a special camera takes pictures of the retina and choroid to find any areas that are blocked or leaking. - ocular coherence tomography : an imaging test that uses light waves to take cross-section pictures of the retina, and sometimes the choroid, to see if there is swelling or fluid beneath the retina. a biopsy of the tumor is rarely needed to diagnose intraocular melanoma. a biopsy is the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. rarely, a biopsy of the tumor is needed to diagnose intraocular melanoma. tissue that is removed during a biopsy or surgery to remove the tumor may be tested to get more information about prognosis and which treatment options are best. the following tests may be done on the sample of tissue: - cytogenetic analysis: a laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes. - gene expression profiling : a laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are checked for certain types of rna. a biopsy may result in retinal detachment (the retina separates from other tissues in the eye). this can be repaired by surgery."
what are the treatments for intraocular (uveal) melanoma ?,"key points - there are different types of treatments for patients with intraocular melanoma. - five types of standard treatment are used: - surgery - watchful waiting - radiation therapy - photocoagulation - thermotherapy - new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - treatment for intraocular (uveal) melanoma may cause side effects. - patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - follow-up tests may be needed. there are different types of treatments for patients with intraocular melanoma. different types of treatments are available for patients with intraocular melanoma. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. five types of standard treatment are used: surgery surgery is the most common treatment for intraocular melanoma. the following types of surgery may be used: - resection: surgery to remove the tumor and a small amount of healthy tissue around it. - enucleation: surgery to remove the eye and part of the optic nerve. this is done if vision cannot be saved and the tumor is large, has spread to the optic nerve, or causes high pressure inside the eye. after surgery, the patient is usually fitted for an artificial eye to match the size and color of the other eye. - exenteration: surgery to remove the eye and eyelid, and muscles, nerves, and fat in the eye socket. after surgery, the patient may be fitted for an artificial eye to match the size and color of the other eye or a facial prosthesis. watchful waiting watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. pictures are taken over time to keep track of changes in the size of the tumor and how fast it is growing. watchful waiting is used for patients who do not have signs or symptoms and the tumor is not growing. it is also used when the tumor is in the only eye with useful vision. radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy: - external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. these types of external radiation therapy include the following: - charged-particle external beam radiation therapy is a type of external-beam radiation therapy. a special radiation therapy machine aims tiny, invisible particles, called protons or helium ions, at the cancer cells to kill them with little damage to nearby normal tissues. charged-particle radiation therapy uses a different type of radiation than the x-ray type of radiation therapy. - gamma knife therapy is a type of stereotactic radiosurgery used for some melanomas. this treatment can be given in one treatment. it aims tightly focused gamma rays directly at the tumor so there is little damage to healthy tissue. gamma knife therapy does not use a knife to remove the tumor and is not an operation. - internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging healthy tissue. this type of internal radiation therapy may include the following: - localized plaque radiation therapy is a type of internal radiation therapy that may be used for tumors of the eye. radioactive seeds are attached to one side of a disk, called a plaque, and placed directly on the outside wall of the eye near the tumor. the side of the plaque with the seeds on it faces the eyeball, aiming radiation at the tumor. the plaque helps protect other nearby tissue from the radiation. the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. external and internal radiation therapy are used to treat intraocular melanoma. photocoagulation photocoagulation is a procedure that uses laser light to destroy blood vessels that bring nutrients to the tumor, causing the tumor cells to die. photocoagulation may be used to treat small tumors. this is also called light coagulation. thermotherapy thermotherapy is the use of heat from a laser to destroy cancer cells and shrink the tumor. new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. treatment for intraocular (uveal) melanoma may cause side effects. for information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, see our side effects page. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials. follow-up tests may be needed. some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. treatment options for intraocular (uveal) melanoma iris melanoma treatment of iris melanoma may include the following: -

what is (are) rectal cancer ?,"key points - rectal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the rectum. - health history affects the risk of developing rectal cancer. - signs of rectal cancer include a change in bowel habits or blood in the stool. - tests that examine the rectum and colon are used to detect (find) and diagnose rectal cancer. - certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. rectal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the rectum. the rectum is part of the bodys digestive system. the digestive system takes in nutrients (vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and water) from foods and helps pass waste material out of the body. the digestive system is made up of the esophagus, stomach, and the small and large intestines. the colon (large bowel) is the first part of the large intestine and is about 5 feet long. together, the rectum and anal canal make up the last part of the large intestine and are 6-8 inches long. the anal canal ends at the anus (the opening of the large intestine to the outside of the body). see the following pdq summaries for more information about rectal cancer: - unusual cancers of childhood treatment (see colorectal cancer section) - colorectal cancer prevention - colorectal cancer screening - gastrointestinal stromal tumors treatment - genetics of colorectal cancer"
what are the stages of rectal cancer ?,"key points - after rectal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the rectum or to other parts of the body. - there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - the following stages are used for rectal cancer: - stage 0 (carcinoma in situ) - stage i - stage ii - stage iii - stage iv after rectal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the rectum or to other parts of the body. the process used to find out whether cancer has spread within the rectum or to other parts of the body is called staging. the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. the following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process: - chest x-ray : an x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. an x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. - colonoscopy : a procedure to look inside the rectum and colon for polyps (small pieces of bulging tissue). abnormal areas, or cancer. a colonoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. it may also have a tool to remove polyps or tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. - ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen, pelvis, or chest, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. - mri (magnetic resonance imaging): a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri). - pet scan (positron emission tomography scan): a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. - endorectal ultrasound : a procedure used to examine the rectum and nearby organs. an ultrasound transducer (probe) is inserted into the rectum and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. the doctor can identify tumors by looking at the sonogram. this procedure is also called transrectal ultrasound. there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: - tissue. the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. - lymph system. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. - blood. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. when cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. - lymph system. the cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. - blood. the cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. for example, if rectal cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually rectal cancer cells. the disease is metastatic rectal cancer, not lung cancer. the following stages are used for rectal cancer: stage 0 (carcinoma in situ) in stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the mucosa (innermost layer) of the rectum wall. these abnormal cells may become cancer and spread. stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ. stage i in stage i, cancer has formed in the mucosa (innermost layer) of the rectum wall and has spread to the submucosa (layer of tissue under the mucosa). cancer may have spread to the muscle layer of the rectum wall. stage ii stage ii rectal cancer is divided into stage iia, stage iib, and stage iic. - stage iia: cancer has spread through the muscle layer of the rectum wall to the serosa (outermost layer) of the rectum wall. - stage iib: cancer has spread through the serosa (outermost layer) of the rectum wall but has not spread to nearby organs. - stage iic: cancer has spread through the serosa (outermost layer) of the rectum wall to nearby organs. stage iii stage iii rectal cancer is divided into stage iiia, stage iiib, and stage iiic. in stage iiia: - cancer has spread through the mucosa (innermost layer) of the rectum wall to the submucosa (layer of tissue under the mucosa) and may have spread to the muscle layer of the rectum wall. cancer has spread to at least one but not more than 3 nearby lymph nodes or cancer cells have formed in tissues near the lymph nodes; or - cancer has spread through the mucosa (innermost layer) of the rectum wall to the submucosa (layer of tissue under the mucosa). cancer has spread to at least 4 but not more than 6 nearby lymph nodes. in stage iiib: - cancer has spread through the muscle layer of the rectum wall to the serosa (outermost layer) of the rectum wall or has spread through the serosa but not to nearby organs. cancer has spread to at least one but not more than 3 nearby lymph nodes or cancer cells have formed in tissues near the lymph nodes; or - cancer has spread to the muscle layer of the rectum wall or to the serosa (outermost layer) of the rectum wall. cancer has spread to at least 4 but not more than 6 nearby lymph nodes; or - cancer has spread through the mucosa (innermost layer) of the rectum wall to the submucosa (layer of tissue under the mucosa) and may have spread to the muscle layer of the rectum wall. cancer has spread to 7 or more nearby lymph nodes. in stage iiic: - cancer has spread through the serosa (outermost layer) of the rectum wall but has not spread to nearby organs. cancer has spread to at least 4 but not more than 6 nearby lymph nodes; or - cancer has spread through the muscle layer of the rectum wall to the serosa (outermost layer) of the rectum wall or has spread through the serosa but has not spread to nearby organs. cancer has spread to 7 or more nearby lymph nodes; or - cancer has spread through the serosa (outermost layer) of the rectum wall and has spread to nearby organs. cancer has spread to one or more nearby lymph nodes or cancer cells have formed in tissues near the lymph nodes. stage iv stage iv rectal cancer is divided into stage iva and stage ivb. - stage iva: cancer may have spread through the rectum wall and may have spread to nearby organs or lymph nodes. cancer has spread to one organ that is not near the rectum, such as the liver, lung, or ovary, or to a distant lymph node. - stage ivb: cancer may have spread through the rectum wall and may have spread to nearby organs or lymph nodes. cancer has spread to more than one organ that is not near the rectum or into the lining of the abdominal wall."
what is (are) myelodysplastic syndromes ?,"key points - myelodysplastic syndromes are a group of cancers in which immature blood cells in the bone marrow do not mature or become healthy blood cells. - the different types of myelodysplastic syndromes are diagnosed based on certain changes in the blood cells and bone marrow. - age and past treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy affect the risk of a myelodysplastic syndrome. - signs and symptoms of a myelodysplastic syndrome include shortness of breath and feeling tired. - tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect (find) and diagnose myelodysplastic syndromes. - certain factors affect prognosis and treatment options. myelodysplastic syndromes are a group of cancers in which immature blood cells in the bone marrow do not mature or become healthy blood cells. in a healthy person, the bone marrow makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time. a blood stem cell may become a lymphoid stem cell or a myeloid stem cell. a lymphoid stem cell becomes a white blood cell. a myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells: - red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body. - platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding. - white blood cells that fight infection and disease. in a patient with a myelodysplastic syndrome, the blood stem cells (immature cells) do not become mature red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets in the bone marrow. these immature blood cells, called blasts, do not work the way they should and either die in the bone marrow or soon after they go into the blood. this leaves less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets to form in the bone marrow. when there are fewer healthy blood cells, infection, anemia, or easy bleeding may occur. the different types of myelodysplastic syndromes are diagnosed based on certain changes in the blood cells and bone marrow. - refractory anemia: there are too few red blood cells in the blood and the patient has anemia. the number of white blood cells and platelets is normal. - refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts: there are too few red blood cells in the blood and the patient has anemia. the red blood cells have too much iron inside the cell. the number of white blood cells and platelets is normal. - refractory anemia with excess blasts: there are too few red blood cells in the blood and the patient has anemia. five percent to 19% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts. there also may be changes to the white blood cells and platelets. refractory anemia with excess blasts may progress to acute myeloid leukemia (aml). see the pdq adult acute myeloid leukemia treatment summary for more information. - refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia: there are too few of at least two types of blood cells (red blood cells, platelets, or white blood cells). less than 5% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts and less than 1% of the cells in the blood are blasts. if red blood cells are affected, they may have extra iron. refractory cytopenia may progress to acute myeloid leukemia (aml). - refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia: there are too few of one type of blood cell (red blood cells, platelets, or white blood cells). there are changes in 10% or more of two other types of blood cells. less than 5% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts and less than 1% of the cells in the blood are blasts. - unclassifiable myelodysplastic syndrome: the numbers of blasts in the bone marrow and blood are normal, and the disease is not one of the other myelodysplastic syndromes. - myelodysplastic syndrome associated with an isolated del(5q) chromosome abnormality: there are too few red blood cells in the blood and the patient has anemia. less than 5% of the cells in the bone marrow and blood are blasts. there is a specific change in the chromosome. - chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (cmml): see the pdq summary on myelodysplastic/ myeloproliferative neoplasms treatment for more information."
what is (are) childhood astrocytomas ?,"key points - childhood astrocytoma is a disease in which benign (noncancer) or malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the brain. - astrocytomas may be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer). - the central nervous system controls many important body functions. - the cause of most childhood brain tumors is not known. - the signs and symptoms of astrocytomas are not the same in every child. - tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect (find) childhood astrocytomas. - childhood astrocytomas are usually diagnosed and removed in surgery. - certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. childhood astrocytoma is a disease in which benign (noncancer) or malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the brain. astrocytomas are tumors that start in star-shaped brain cells called astrocytes. an astrocyte is a type of glial cell. glial cells hold nerve cells in place, bring food and oxygen to them, and help protect them from disease, such as infection. gliomas are tumors that form from glial cells. an astrocytoma is a type of glioma. astrocytoma is the most common type of glioma diagnosed in children. it can form anywhere in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). this summary is about the treatment of tumors that begin in astrocytes in the brain (primary brain tumors). metastatic brain tumors are formed by cancer cells that begin in other parts of the body and spread to the brain. treatment of metastatic brain tumors is not discussed here. brain tumors can occur in both children and adults. however, treatment for children may be different than treatment for adults. see the following pdq summaries for more information about other types of brain tumors in children and adults: - childhood brain and spinal cord tumors treatment overview - adult central nervous system tumors treatment astrocytomas may be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer). benign brain tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain. they rarely spread into other tissues. malignant brain tumors are likely to grow quickly and spread into other brain tissue. when a tumor grows into or presses on an area of the brain, it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should. both benign and malignant brain tumors can cause signs and symptoms and almost all need treatment. the central nervous system controls many important body functions. astrocytomas are most common in these parts of the central nervous system (cns): - cerebrum : the largest part of the brain, at the top of the head. the cerebrum controls thinking, learning, problem-solving, speech, emotions, reading, writing, and voluntary movement. - cerebellum : the lower, back part of the brain (near the middle of the back of the head). the cerebellum controls movement, balance, and posture. - brain stem : the part that connects the brain to the spinal cord, in the lowest part of the brain (just above the back of the neck). the brain stem controls breathing, heart rate, and the nerves and muscles used in seeing, hearing, walking, talking, and eating. - hypothalamus : the area in the middle of the base of the brain. it controls body temperature, hunger, and thirst. - visual pathway: the group of nerves that connect the eye with the brain. - spinal cord: the column of nerve tissue that runs from the brain stem down the center of the back. it is covered by three thin layers of tissue called membranes. the spinal cord and membranes are surrounded by the vertebrae (back bones). spinal cord nerves carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body, such as a message from the brain to cause muscles to move or a message from the skin to the brain to feel touch."
what are the symptoms of metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary ?,signs and symptoms of metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary include a lump or pain in the neck or throat. check with your doctor if you have a lump or pain in your neck or throat that doesn't go away. these and other signs and symptoms may be caused by metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary. other conditions may cause the same signs and symptoms.
what are the stages of metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary ?,"key points - after metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body. - there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. after metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body. the process used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body is called staging. the results from tests and procedures used to detect and diagnose the primary tumor are also used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body. there is no standard staging system for metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary. the tumors are described as untreated or recurrent. untreated metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary is cancer that is newly diagnosed and has not been treated, except to relieve signs and symptoms caused by the cancer. there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: - tissue. the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. - lymph system. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. - blood. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body."
what is (are) childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies ?,"key points - childhood acute myeloid leukemia (aml) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes a large number of abnormal blood cells. - leukemia and other diseases of the blood and bone marrow may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. - other myeloid diseases can affect the blood and bone marrow. - chronic myelogenous leukemia - juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia - myelodysplastic syndromes - aml or mds may occur after treatment with certain anticancer drugs and/or radiation therapy. - the risk factors for childhood aml, childhood cml, jmml, and mds are similar. - signs and symptoms of childhood aml, childhood cml, jmml, or mds include fever, feeling tired, and easy bleeding or bruising. - tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood aml, childhood cml, jmml, and mds. - certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. childhood acute myeloid leukemia (aml) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes a large number of abnormal blood cells. childhood acute myeloid leukemia (aml) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. aml is also called acute myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, acute granulocytic leukemia, and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. cancers that are acute usually get worse quickly if they are not treated. cancers that are chronic usually get worse slowly. leukemia and other diseases of the blood and bone marrow may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. normally, the bone marrow makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time. a blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell. a lymphoid stem cell becomes a white blood cell. a myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells: - red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body. - white blood cells that fight infection and disease. - platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding. in aml, the myeloid stem cells usually become a type of immature white blood cell called myeloblasts (or myeloid blasts). the myeloblasts, or leukemia cells, in aml are abnormal and do not become healthy white blood cells. the leukemia cells can build up in the blood and bone marrow so there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. when this happens, infection, anemia, or easy bleeding may occur. the leukemia cells can spread outside the blood to other parts of the body, including the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), skin, and gums. sometimes leukemia cells form a solid tumor called a granulocytic sarcoma or chloroma. there are subtypes of aml based on the type of blood cell that is affected. the treatment of aml is different when it is a subtype called acute promyelocytic leukemia (apl) or when the child has down syndrome. other myeloid diseases can affect the blood and bone marrow. chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic myelogenous leukemia (cml), too many bone marrow stem cells become a type of white blood cell called granulocytes. some of these bone marrow stem cells never become mature white blood cells. these are called blasts. over time, the granulocytes and blasts crowd out the red blood cells and platelets in the bone marrow. cml is rare in children. juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (jmml) is a rare childhood cancer that occurs more often in children around the age of 2 years and is more common in boys. in jmml, too many bone marrow stem cells become 2 types of white blood cells called myelocytes and monocytes. some of these bone marrow stem cells never become mature white blood cells. these immature cells, called blasts, are unable to do their usual work. over time, the myelocytes, monocytes, and blasts crowd out the red blood cells and platelets in the bone marrow. when this happens, infection, anemia, or easy bleeding may occur. myelodysplastic syndromes myelodysplastic syndromes (mds) occur less often in children than in adults. in mds, the bone marrow makes too few red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. these blood cells may not mature and enter the blood. the treatment for mds depends on how low the numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets are. over time, mds may become aml. transient myeloproliferative disorder (tmd) is a type of mds. this disorder of the bone marrow can develop in newborns who have down syndrome. it usually goes away on its own within the first 3 weeks of life. infants who have down syndrome and tmd have an increased chance of developing aml before the age of 3 years. this summary is about childhood aml, childhood cml, jmml, and mds. see the following pdq summaries for more information about other types of leukemia and diseases of the blood and bone marrow in children and adults: - childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment - adult acute myeloid leukemia treatment - adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment - chronic myelogenous leukemia treatment - chronic lymphocytic leukemia treatment - hairy cell leukemia treatment - myelodysplastic syndromes treatment - myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms treatment aml or mds may occur after treatment with certain anticancer drugs and/or radiation therapy. cancer treatment with certain anticancer drugs and/or radiation therapy may cause therapy -related aml (t-aml) or therapy-related mds (t-mds). the risk of these therapy-related myeloid diseases depends on the total dose of the anticancer drugs used and the radiation dose and treatment field. some patients also have an inherited risk for t-aml and t-mds. these therapy-related diseases usually occur within 7 years after treatment, but are rare in children."
who is at risk for childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies? ?,"the risk factors for childhood aml, childhood cml, jmml, and mds are similar. anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. talk with your childs doctor if you think your child may be at risk. these and other factors may increase the risk of childhood aml, childhood cml, jmml, and mds: - having a brother or sister, especially a twin, with leukemia. - being hispanic. - being exposed to cigarette smoke or alcohol before birth. - having a personal history of aplastic anemia. - having a personal or family history of mds. - having a family history of aml. - past treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. - being exposed to ionizing radiation or chemicals such as benzene. - having certain genetic disorders, such as: - down syndrome. - fanconi anemia. - neurofibromatosis type 1. - noonan syndrome. - shwachman-diamond syndrome."
what is the outlook for childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies ?,"certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for childhood aml depend on the following: - the age of the child when the cancer is diagnosed. - the race or ethnic group of the child. - whether the child is greatly overweight. - number of white blood cells in the blood at diagnosis. - whether the aml occurred after previous cancer treatment. - the subtype of aml. - whether there are certain chromosome or gene changes in the leukemia cells. - whether the child has down syndrome. most children with aml and down syndrome can be cured of their leukemia. - whether the leukemia is in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). - how quickly the leukemia responds to treatment. - whether the aml is newly diagnosed (untreated) or has recurred (come back) after being treated. - the length of time since treatment ended, for aml that has recurred. the prognosis and treatment options for childhood cml depend on how long it has been since the patient was diagnosed and how many blast cells are in the blood. the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for jmml depend on the following: - the age of the child when the cancer is diagnosed. - the type of gene affected and the number of genes that have changes. - how many red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets are in the blood. - whether the jmml is newly diagnosed (untreated) or has recurred after treatment. the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for mds depend on the following: - whether the mds was caused by previous cancer treatment. - how low the numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets are. - whether the mds is newly diagnosed (untreated) or has recurred after treatment."
what are the treatments for childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies ?,"key points - there are different types of treatment for children with acute myeloid leukemia (aml), chronic myelogenous leukemia (cml), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (jmml), or myelodysplastic syndromes (mds). - treatment is planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood leukemia and other diseases of the blood. - some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended. - the treatment of childhood aml usually has two phases. - seven types of standard treatment are used for childhood aml, childhood cml, jmml, or mds. - chemotherapy - radiation therapy - stem cell transplant - targeted therapy - other drug therapy - watchful waiting - supportive care - new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - biologic therapy - patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - follow-up tests may be needed. there are different types of treatment for children with acute myeloid leukemia (aml), chronic myelogenous leukemia (cml), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (jmml), or myelodysplastic syndromes (mds). different types of treatment are available for children with aml, cml, jmml, or mds. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. treatment is planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood leukemia and other diseases of the blood. treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. the pediatric oncologist works with other healthcare providers who are experts in treating children with leukemia and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. these may include the following specialists: - pediatrician. - hematologist. - medical oncologist. - pediatric surgeon. - radiation oncologist. - neurologist. - neuropathologist. - neuroradiologist. - pediatric nurse specialist. - social worker. - rehabilitation specialist. - psychologist. some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended. regular follow-up exams are very important. some cancer treatments cause side effects that continue or appear months or years after cancer treatment has ended. these are called late effects. late effects of cancer treatment may include: - physical problems. - changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory. - second cancers (new types of cancer). some late effects may be treated or controlled. it is important that parents of children who are treated for aml or other blood diseases talk with their doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on their child. (see the pdq summary on late effects of treatment for childhood cancer for more information). the treatment of childhood aml usually has two phases. the treatment of childhood aml is done in phases: - induction therapy: this is the first phase of treatment. the goal is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow. this puts the leukemia into remission. - consolidation /intensification therapy: this is the second phase of treatment. it begins once the leukemia is in remission. the goal of therapy is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could begin to regrow and cause a relapse. treatment called central nervous system (cns) sanctuary therapy may be given during the induction phase of therapy. because standard doses of chemotherapy may not reach leukemia cells in the cns (brain and spinal cord), the cells are able to find sanctuary (hide) in the cns. intrathecal chemotherapy is able to reach leukemia cells in the cns. it is given to kill the leukemia cells and lessen the chance the leukemia will recur (come back). cns sanctuary therapy is also called cns prophylaxis. seven types of standard treatment are used for childhood aml, childhood cml, jmml, or mds. chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal chemotherapy), an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated. in aml, the leukemia cells may spread to the brain and/or spinal cord. chemotherapy given by mouth or vein to treat aml may not cross the blood-brain barrier to get into the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. instead, chemotherapy is injected into the fluid-filled space to kill leukemia cells that may have spread there (intrathecal chemotherapy). see drugs approved for acute myeloid leukemia for more information. radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy: - external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. - internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated. in childhood aml, external radiation therapy may be used to treat a chloroma that does not respond to chemotherapy. stem cell transplant stem cell transplant is a way of giving chemotherapy and replacing blood-forming cells that are abnormal or destroyed by the cancer treatment. stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. after the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. these reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells. targeted therapy targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. types of targeted therapy include the following: - tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy: tyrosine kinase inhibitor (tki) therapy blocks signals needed for tumors to grow. tkis block the enzyme (tyrosine kinase) that causes stem cells to become more white blood cells (granulocytes or blasts) than the body needs. tkis may be used with other anticancer drugs as adjuvant therapy (treatment given after the initial treatment, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back). - imatinib is a type of tki that is approved to treat childhood cml. - sorafenib, dasatinib, and nilotinib are being studied in the treatment of childhood leukemia. - monoclonal antibody therapy: monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory, from a single type of immune system cell. these antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. the antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. they may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. - gemtuzumab is a type of monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of a subtype of aml called acute promyelocytic leukemia (apl). gemtuzumab is not available in the united states unless special approval is given. monoclonal antibodies may be used with chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy. - proteasome inhibitor therapy: proteasome inhibitors break down proteins in cancer cells and kill them. - bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor used to treat childhood apl. see drugs approved for leukemia for more information. other drug therapy lenalidomide may be used to lessen the need for transfusions in patients who have myelodysplastic syndromes caused by a specific chromosome change. arsenic trioxide and all-trans retinoic acid (atra) are anticancer drugs that kill leukemia cells, stop the leukemia cells from dividing, or help the leukemia cells mature into white blood cells. these drugs are used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. see drugs approved for acute myeloid leukemia for more information. watchful waiting watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. it is sometimes used to treat mds or tmd. supportive care supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment. supportive care may include the following: - transfusion therapy: a way of giving red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets to replace blood cells destroyed by disease or cancer treatment. the blood may be donated from another person or it may have been taken from the patient earlier and stored until needed. - drug therapy, such as antibiotics or antifungal agents. - leukapheresis: a procedure in which a special machine is used to remove white blood cells from the blood. blood is taken from the patient and put through a blood cell separator where the white blood cells are removed. the rest of the blood is then returned to the patient's bloodstream. new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. it may not mention every new treatment being studied. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. biologic therapy biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy. natural killer (nk) cells are a type of biologic therapy. nk cells are white blood cells that can kill tumor cells. these may be taken from a donor and given to the patient by infusion to help kill leukemia cells. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials. follow-up tests may be needed. some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. treatment options for childhood acute myeloid leukemia, childhood chronic myelogenous leukemia, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes newly diagnosed childhood acute myeloid leukemia treatment of newly diagnosed childhood acute myeloid leukemia may include the following: - combination chemotherapy plus central nervous system sanctuary therapy with intrathecal chemotherapy. - a clinical trial comparing different chemotherapy regimens (doses and schedules of treatment). - a clinical trial of combination chemotherapy and targeted therapy with a proteasome inhibitor or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with or without stem cell transplant. treatment of newly diagnosed childhood acute leukemia with a granulocytic sarcoma (chloroma) may include chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy. treatment of therapy -related aml is usually the same as for newly diagnosed aml, followed by stem cell transplant. check the list of nci-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with untreated childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies. for more specific results, refine the search by using other search features, such as the location of the trial, the type of treatment, or the name of the drug. talk with your child's doctor about clinical trials that may be right for your child. general information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. children with newly diagnosed childhood aml and down syndrome treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (aml) in children aged 4 years or younger who have down syndrome may include the following: - combination chemotherapy plus central nervous system sanctuary therapy with intrathecal chemotherapy. treatment of aml in children older than 4 years who have down syndrome may be the same as treatment for children without down syndrome. childhood acute myeloid leukemia in remission treatment of childhood acute myeloid leukemia (aml) during the remission phase (consolidation /intensification therapy) depends on the subtype of aml and may include the following: -

who is at risk for childhood brain stem glioma? ?,"anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk. possible risk factors for brain stem glioma include: - having certain genetic disorders, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1)."
what are the symptoms of childhood brain stem glioma ?,the signs and symptoms of brain stem glioma are not the same in every child. signs and symptoms depend on the following: - where the tumor forms in the brain. - the size of the tumor and whether it has spread all through the brain stem. - how fast the tumor grows. - the child's age and development. some tumors do not cause signs or symptoms. signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood brain stem gliomas or by other conditions. check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following: - loss of ability to move one side of the face and/or body. - loss of balance and trouble walking. - vision and hearing problems. - morning headache or headache that goes away after vomiting. - nausea and vomiting. - unusual sleepiness. - more or less energy than usual. - changes in behavior. - trouble learning in school.

what is (are) gestational trophoblastic disease ?,"key points - gestational trophoblastic disease (gtd) is a group of rare diseases in which abnormal trophoblast cells grow inside the uterus after conception. - hydatidiform mole (hm) is the most common type of gtd. - gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (gtn) is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease (gtd) that is almost always malignant. - invasive moles - choriocarcinomas - placental-site trophoblastic tumors - epithelioid trophoblastic tumors - age and a previous molar pregnancy affect the risk of gtd. - signs of gtd include abnormal vaginal bleeding and a uterus that is larger than normal. - tests that examine the uterus are used to detect (find) and diagnose gestational trophoblastic disease. - certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. gestational trophoblastic disease (gtd) is a group of rare diseases in which abnormal trophoblast cells grow inside the uterus after conception. in gestational trophoblastic disease (gtd), a tumor develops inside the uterus from tissue that forms after conception (the joining of sperm and egg). this tissue is made of trophoblast cells and normally surrounds the fertilized egg in the uterus. trophoblast cells help connect the fertilized egg to the wall of the uterus and form part of the placenta (the organ that passes nutrients from the mother to the fetus). sometimes there is a problem with the fertilized egg and trophoblast cells. instead of a healthy fetus developing, a tumor forms. until there are signs or symptoms of the tumor, the pregnancy will seem like a normal pregnancy. most gtd is benign (not cancer) and does not spread, but some types become malignant (cancer) and spread to nearby tissues or distant parts of the body. gestational trophoblastic disease (gtd) is a general term that includes different types of disease: - hydatidiform moles (hm) - complete hm. - partial hm. - gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (gtn) - invasive moles. - choriocarcinomas. - placental-site trophoblastic tumors (pstt; very rare). - epithelioid trophoblastic tumors (ett; even more rare). hydatidiform mole (hm) is the most common type of gtd. hms are slow-growing tumors that look like sacs of fluid. an hm is also called a molar pregnancy. the cause of hydatidiform moles is not known. hms may be complete or partial: - a complete hm forms when sperm fertilizes an egg that does not contain the mothers dna. the egg has dna from the father and the cells that were meant to become the placenta are abnormal. - a partial hm forms when sperm fertilizes a normal egg and there are two sets of dna from the father in the fertilized egg. only part of the fetus forms and the cells that were meant to become the placenta are abnormal. most hydatidiform moles are benign, but they sometimes become cancer. having one or more of the following risk factors increases the risk that a hydatidiform mole will become cancer: - a pregnancy before 20 or after 35 years of age. - a very high level of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (-hcg), a hormone made by the body during pregnancy. - a large tumor in the uterus. - an ovarian cyst larger than 6 centimeters. - high blood pressure during pregnancy. - an overactive thyroid gland (extra thyroid hormone is made). - severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. - trophoblastic cells in the blood, which may block small blood vessels. - serious blood clotting problems caused by the hm. gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (gtn) is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease (gtd) that is almost always malignant. gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (gtn) includes the following: invasive moles invasive moles are made up of trophoblast cells that grow into the muscle layer of the uterus. invasive moles are more likely to grow and spread than a hydatidiform mole. rarely, a complete or partial hm may become an invasive mole. sometimes an invasive mole will disappear without treatment. choriocarcinomas a choriocarcinoma is a malignant tumor that forms from trophoblast cells and spreads to the muscle layer of the uterus and nearby blood vessels. it may also spread to other parts of the body, such as the brain, lungs, liver, kidney, spleen, intestines, pelvis, or vagina. a choriocarcinoma is more likely to form in women who have had any of the following: - molar pregnancy, especially with a complete hydatidiform mole. - normal pregnancy. - tubal pregnancy (the fertilized egg implants in the fallopian tube rather than the uterus). - miscarriage. placental-site trophoblastic tumors a placental-site trophoblastic tumor (pstt) is a rare type of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia that forms where the placenta attaches to the uterus. the tumor forms from trophoblast cells and spreads into the muscle of the uterus and into blood vessels. it may also spread to the lungs, pelvis, or lymph nodes. a pstt grows very slowly and signs or symptoms may appear months or years after a normal pregnancy. epithelioid trophoblastic tumors an epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ett) is a very rare type of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia that may be benign or malignant. when the tumor is malignant, it may spread to the lungs."
what are the stages of gestational trophoblastic disease ?,"key points - after gestational trophoblastic neoplasia has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer has spread from where it started to other parts of the body. - there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - there is no staging system for hydatidiform moles. - the following stages are used for gtn: - stage i - stage ii - stage iii - stage iv - the treatment of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia is based on the type of disease, stage, or risk group. after gestational trophoblastic neoplasia has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer has spread from where it started to other parts of the body. the process used to find out the extent or spread of cancer is called staging, the information gathered from the staging process helps determine the stage of disease. for gtn, stage is one of the factors used to plan treatment. the following tests and procedures may be done to help find out the stage of the disease: - chest x-ray : an x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. an x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body onto film, making pictures of areas inside the body. - ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. - mri (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as brain and spinal cord. a substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. the gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri). - lumbar puncture : a procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (csf) from the spinal column. this is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the csf around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid. the sample of csf is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord. this procedure is also called an lp or spinal tap. there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: - tissue. the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. - lymph system. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. - blood. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. when cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. - lymph system. the cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. - blood. the cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. for example, if choriocarcinoma spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually choriocarcinoma cells. the disease is metastatic choriocarcinoma, not lung cancer. there is no staging system for hydatidiform moles. hydatidiform moles (hm) are found in the uterus only and do not spread to other parts of the body. the following stages are used for gtn: stage i in stage i, the tumor is in the uterus only. stage ii in stage ii, cancer has spread outside of the uterus to the ovary, fallopian tube, vagina, and/or the ligaments that support the uterus. stage iii in stage iii, cancer has spread to the lung. stage iv in stage iv, cancer has spread to distant parts of the body other than the lungs. the treatment of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia is based on the type of disease, stage, or risk group. invasive moles and choriocarcinomas are treated based on risk groups. the stage of the invasive mole or choriocarcinoma is one factor used to determine risk group. other factors include the following: - the age of the patient when the diagnosis is made. - whether the gtn occurred after a molar pregnancy, miscarriage, or normal pregnancy. - how soon the tumor was diagnosed after the pregnancy began. - the level of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (-hcg) in the blood. - the size of the largest tumor. - where the tumor has spread to and the number of tumors in the body. - how many chemotherapy drugs the tumor has been treated with (for recurrent or resistant tumors). there are two risk groups for invasive moles and choriocarcinomas: low risk and high risk. patients with low-risk disease usually receive less aggressive treatment than patients with high-risk disease. placental-site trophoblastic tumor (pstt) and epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ett) treatments depend on the stage of disease."
"what are the symptoms of ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer ?","signs and symptoms of ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer include pain or swelling in the abdomen. ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer may not cause early signs or symptoms. when signs or symptoms do appear, the cancer is often advanced. signs and symptoms may include the following: - pain, swelling, or a feeling of pressure in the abdomen or pelvis. - vaginal bleeding that is heavy or irregular, especially after menopause. - vaginal discharge that is clear, white, or colored with blood. - a lump in the pelvic area. - gastrointestinal problems, such as gas, bloating, or constipation. these signs and symptoms also may be caused by other conditions and not by ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer. if the signs or symptoms get worse or do not go away on their own, check with your doctor so that any problem can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
how to prevent oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer ?,"key points - avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer. - the following are risk factors for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer: - tobacco use - alcohol use - tobacco and alcohol use - betel quid or gutka chewing - personal history of head and neck cancer - the following is a risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer: - hpv infection - the following is a protective factor for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer: - quitting smoking - it is not clear whether avoiding certain risk factors will decrease the risk of oral cavity cancer or oropharyngeal cancer. - cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer. - new ways to prevent oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer are being studied in clinical trials. avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer. avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise. increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer. oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer are two different diseases, but they have some risk factors in common. the following are risk factors for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer: tobacco use using tobacco is the most common cause of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer. the risk of these cancers is about 5 to 10 times higher for current smokers than for people who have never smoked. the use of all types of tobacco, including cigarettes, pipes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco (snuff and chewing tobacco) can cause cancer of the oral cavity and oropharynx. for cigarette smokers, the risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day. alcohol use using alcohol is also an important risk factor for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer. the risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer increases with the number of alcoholic drinks consumed per day. the risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is about twice as high in people who have 3 to 4 alcoholic drinks per day and 5 times higher in people who have 5 or more alcoholic drinks per day compared with those who don't drink alcohol. tobacco and alcohol use the risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is 2 to 3 times higher in people who use both tobacco and alcohol than it is in people who use only tobacco or only alcohol. the risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is about 35 times higher in people who smoke 2 or more packs of cigarettes per day and have more than 4 alcoholic drinks per day than it is in people who have never smoked cigarettes or consumed alcohol. betel quid or gutka chewing chewing betel quid or gutka (betel quid mixed with tobacco) has been shown to increase the risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer. betel quid contains areca nut, which is a cancer-causing substance. the risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer increases with how long and how often betel quid or gutka are chewed. the risk for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is higher when chewing gutka than when chewing betel quid alone. betel quid and gutka chewing is common in many countries in south asia and southeast asia, including china and india. personal history of head and neck cancer a personal history of head and neck cancer increases the risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer. the following is a risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer: hpv infection being infected with certain types of hpv, especially hpv type 16, increases the risk of oropharyngeal cancer. hpv infection is spread mainly through sexual contact. the risk of oropharyngeal cancer is about 15 times higher in people who have oral hpv 16 infection compared with people who do not have oral hpv 16 infection. the following is a protective factor for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer: quitting smoking studies have shown that when people stop smoking cigarettes, their risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer decreases by one half (50%) within 5 years. within 20 years of quitting, their risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is the same as for a person who never smoked cigarettes. it is not clear whether avoiding certain risk factors will decrease the risk of oral cavity cancer or oropharyngeal cancer. it has not been proven that stopping alcohol use will decrease the risk of oral cavity cancer or oropharyngeal cancer. getting an hpv vaccination greatly lessens the risk of oral hpv infection. it is not yet known whether getting an hpv vaccination at any age will decrease the risk of oropharyngeal cancer from hpv infection. cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer. cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of certain types of cancer. some cancer prevention trials are done with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. other prevention trials are done with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer. the purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. these may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements. new ways to prevent oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer are being studied in clinical trials. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. information about clinical trials can be found in the clinical trials section of the nci website. check nci's list of cancer clinical trials for oral cavity

what are the treatments for pancreatic cancer ?,"key points - there are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer. - five types of standard treatment are used: - surgery - radiation therapy - chemotherapy - chemoradiation therapy - targeted therapy - there are treatments for pain caused by pancreatic cancer. - patients with pancreatic cancer have special nutritional needs. - new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - biologic therapy - patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - follow-up tests may be needed there are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer. different types of treatment are available for patients with pancreatic cancer. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. five types of standard treatment are used: surgery one of the following types of surgery may be used to take out the tumor: - whipple procedure: a surgical procedure in which the head of the pancreas, the gallbladder, part of the stomach, part of the small intestine, and the bile duct are removed. enough of the pancreas is left to produce digestive juices and insulin. - total pancreatectomy: this operation removes the whole pancreas, part of the stomach, part of the small intestine, the common bile duct, the gallbladder, the spleen, and nearby lymph nodes. - distal pancreatectomy: the body and the tail of the pancreas and usually the spleen are removed. if the cancer has spread and cannot be removed, the following types of palliative surgery may be done to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life: - surgical biliary bypass: if cancer is blocking the small intestine and bile is building up in the gallbladder, a biliary bypass may be done. during this operation, the doctor will cut the gallbladder or bile duct and sew it to the small intestine to create a new pathway around the blocked area. - endoscopic stent placement: if the tumor is blocking the bile duct, surgery may be done to put in a stent (a thin tube) to drain bile that has built up in the area. the doctor may place the stent through a catheter that drains to the outside of the body or the stent may go around the blocked area and drain the bile into the small intestine. - gastric bypass: if the tumor is blocking the flow of food from the stomach, the stomach may be sewn directly to the small intestine so the patient can continue to eat normally. radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy: - external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. - internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. external radiation therapy is used to treat pancreatic cancer. chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. see drugs approved for pancreatic cancer for more information. chemoradiation therapy chemoradiation therapy combines chemotherapy and radiation therapy to increase the effects of both. targeted therapy targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis) are targeted therapy drugs that block signals needed for tumors to grow. erlotinib is a type of tki used to treat pancreatic cancer. see drugs approved for pancreatic cancer for more information. there are treatments for pain caused by pancreatic cancer. pain can occur when the tumor presses on nerves or other organs near the pancreas. when pain medicine is not enough, there are treatments that act on nerves in the abdomen to relieve the pain. the doctor may inject medicine into the area around affected nerves or may cut the nerves to block the feeling of pain. radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy can also help relieve pain by shrinking the tumor. see the pdq summary on cancer pain for more information. patients with pancreatic cancer have special nutritional needs. surgery to remove the pancreas may affect its ability to make pancreatic enzymes that help to digest food. as a result, patients may have problems digesting food and absorbing nutrients into the body. to prevent malnutrition, the doctor may prescribe medicines that replace these enzymes. see the pdq summary on nutrition in cancer care for more information. new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. it may not mention every new treatment being studied. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. biologic therapy biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials. follow-up tests may be needed some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. treatment options by stage stages i and ii pancreatic cancer treatment of stage i and stage ii pancreatic cancer may include the following: - surgery. - surgery followed by chemotherapy. - surgery followed by chemoradiation. - a clinical trial of combination chemotherapy. - a clinical trial of chemotherapy and targeted therapy, with or without chemoradiation. - a clinical trial of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy before surgery. check the list of nci-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with stage i pancreatic cancer and stage ii pancreatic cancer. for more specific results, refine the search by using other search features, such as the location of the trial, the type of treatment, or the name of the drug. talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you. general information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. stage iii pancreatic cancer treatment of stage iii pancreatic cancer may include the following: - palliative surgery or stent placement to bypass

what are the treatments for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (islet cell tumors) ?,"key points - there are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic nets. - six types of standard treatment are used: - surgery - chemotherapy - hormone therapy - hepatic arterial occlusion or chemoembolization - targeted therapy - supportive care - new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - follow-up tests may be needed. there are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic nets. different types of treatments are available for patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (nets). some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. six types of standard treatment are used: surgery an operation may be done to remove the tumor. one of the following types of surgery may be used: - enucleation: surgery to remove the tumor only. this may be done when cancer occurs in one place in the pancreas. - pancreatoduodenectomy: a surgical procedure in which the head of the pancreas, the gallbladder, nearby lymph nodes and part of the stomach, small intestine, and bile duct are removed. enough of the pancreas is left to make digestive juices and insulin. the organs removed during this procedure depend on the patient's condition. this is also called the whipple procedure. - distal pancreatectomy: surgery to remove the body and tail of the pancreas. the spleen may also be removed. - total gastrectomy: surgery to remove the whole stomach. - parietal cell vagotomy: surgery to cut the nerve that causes stomach cells to make acid. - liver resection: surgery to remove part or all of the liver. - radiofrequency ablation: the use of a special probe with tiny electrodes that kill cancer cells. sometimes the probe is inserted directly through the skin and only local anesthesia is needed. in other cases, the probe is inserted through an incision in the abdomen. this is done in the hospital with general anesthesia. - cryosurgical ablation: a procedure in which tissue is frozen to destroy abnormal cells. this is usually done with a special instrument that contains liquid nitrogen or liquid carbon dioxide. the instrument may be used during surgery or laparoscopy or inserted through the skin. this procedure is also called cryoablation. chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). combination chemotherapy is the use of more than one anticancer drug. the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated. hormone therapy hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. if tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working. hepatic arterial occlusion or chemoembolization hepatic arterial occlusion uses drugs, small particles, or other agents to block or reduce the flow of blood to the liver through the hepatic artery (the major blood vessel that carries blood to the liver). this is done to kill cancer cells growing in the liver. the tumor is prevented from getting the oxygen and nutrients it needs to grow. the liver continues to receive blood from the hepatic portal vein, which carries blood from the stomach and intestine. chemotherapy delivered during hepatic arterial occlusion is called chemoembolization. the anticancer drug is injected into the hepatic artery through a catheter (thin tube). the drug is mixed with the substance that blocks the artery and cuts off blood flow to the tumor. most of the anticancer drug is trapped near the tumor and only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body. the blockage may be temporary or permanent, depending on the substance used to block the artery. targeted therapy targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. certain types of targeted therapies are being studied in the treatment of pancreatic nets. supportive care supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment. supportive care for pancreatic nets may include treatment for the following: - stomach ulcers may be treated with drug therapy such as: - proton pump inhibitor drugs such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, or pantoprazole. - histamine blocking drugs such as cimetidine, ranitidine, or famotidine. - somatostatin-type drugs such as octreotide. - diarrhea may be treated with: - intravenous (iv) fluids with electrolytes such as potassium or chloride. - somatostatin-type drugs such as octreotide. - low blood sugar may be treated by having small, frequent meals or with drug therapy to maintain a normal blood sugar level. - high blood sugar may be treated with drugs taken by mouth or insulin by injection. new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials. follow-up tests may be needed. some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. treatment options for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors gastrinoma treatment of gastrinoma may include supportive care and the following: - for symptoms caused by too much stomach acid, treatment may be a drug that decreases the amount of acid made by the stomach. - for a single tumor in the head of the pancreas: - surgery to remove the tumor. -

how to diagnose salivary gland cancer ?,"tests that examine the head, neck, and the inside of the mouth are used to detect (find) and diagnose salivary gland cancer. the following procedures may be used: - physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health. the head, neck, mouth, and throat will be checked for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. - mri (magnetic resonance imaging): a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri). - ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. - pet scan (positron emission tomography scan): a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. - endoscopy : a procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for abnormal areas. for salivary gland cancer, an endoscope is inserted into the mouth to look at the mouth, throat, and larynx. an endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. - biopsy : the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. - fine needle aspiration (fna) biopsy : the removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle. an fna is the most common type of biopsy used for salivary gland cancer. - incisional biopsy : the removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue that doesnt look normal. - surgery : if cancer cannot be diagnosed from the sample of tissue removed during an fna biopsy or an incisional biopsy, the mass may be removed and checked for signs of cancer. because salivary gland cancer can be hard to diagnose, patients should ask to have the tissue samples checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing salivary gland cancer."
what are the stages of salivary gland cancer ?,"key points - after salivary gland cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the salivary gland or to other parts of the body. - there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - the following stages are used for major salivary gland cancers: - stage i - stage ii - stage iii - stage iv after salivary gland cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the salivary gland or to other parts of the body. the process used to find out if cancer has spread within the salivary glands or to other parts of the body is called staging. the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. the following procedures may be used in the staging process: - mri (magnetic resonance imaging): a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri). - ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: - tissue. the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. - lymph system. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. - blood. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. when cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. - lymph system. the cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. - blood. the cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. for example, if salivary gland cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually salivary gland cancer cells. the disease is metastatic salivary gland cancer, not lung cancer. the following stages are used for major salivary gland cancers: stage i in stage i, the tumor is in the salivary gland only and is 2 centimeters or smaller. stage ii in stage ii, the tumor is in the salivary gland only and is larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 4 centimeters. stage iii in stage iii, one of the following is true: - the tumor is not larger than 4 centimeters and has spread to a single lymph node on the same side as the tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller. - the tumor is larger than 4 centimeters and/or has spread to soft tissue around the affected gland. cancer may have spread to a single lymph node on the same side as the tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller. stage iv stage iv is divided into stages iva, ivb, and ivc as follows: - stage iva: - the tumor may be any size and may have spread to soft tissue around the affected gland. cancer has spread to a single lymph node on the same side as the tumor and the lymph node is larger than 3 centimeters but not larger than 6 centimeters, or has spread to more than one lymph node on either or both sides of the body and the lymph nodes are not larger than 6 centimeters; or - cancer has spread to the skin, jawbone, ear canal, and/or facial nerve, and may have spread to one or more lymph nodes on either or both sides of the body. the lymph nodes are not larger than 6 centimeters. - stage ivb: - the tumor may be any size and may have spread to soft tissue around the affected gland. cancer has spread to a lymph node larger than 6 centimeters; or - cancer has spread to the base of the skull and/or the carotid artery, and may have spread to one or more lymph nodes of any size on either or both sides of the body. - stage ivc: - the tumor may be any size and may have spread to soft tissue around the affected gland, to the skin, jawbone, ear canal, facial nerve, base of the skull, or carotid artery, or to one or more lymph nodes on either or both sides of the body. cancer has spread to distant parts of the body. salivary gland cancers are also grouped by grade. the grade of a tumor tells how fast the cancer cells are growing, based on how the cells look under a microscope. low-grade cancers grow more slowly than high-grade cancers. minor salivary gland cancers are staged according to where they were first found in the body."
how to diagnose gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors ?,"imaging studies and tests that examine the blood and urine are used to detect (find) and diagnose gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors. the following tests and procedures may be used: - physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. - blood chemistry studies : a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as hormones, released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. an unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. the blood sample is checked to see if it contains a hormone produced by carcinoid tumors. this test is used to help diagnose carcinoid syndrome. - tumor marker test : a procedure in which a sample of blood, urine, or tissue is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as chromogranin a, made by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. chromogranin a is a tumor marker. it has been linked to neuroendocrine tumors when found in increased levels in the body. - twenty-four-hour urine test: a test in which urine is collected for 24 hours to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as 5-hiaa or serotonin (hormone). an unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that makes it. this test is used to help diagnose carcinoid syndrome. - mibg scan : a procedure used to find neuroendocrine tumors, such as carcinoid tumors. a very small amount of radioactive material called mibg (metaiodobenzylguanidine) is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. carcinoid tumors take up the radioactive material and are detected by a device that measures radiation. - ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. - mri (magnetic resonance imaging): a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging - pet scan (positron emission tomography scan): a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells. - endoscopic ultrasound (eus): a procedure in which an endoscope is inserted into the body, usually through the mouth or rectum. an endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. a probe at the end of the endoscope is used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs, such as the stomach, small intestine, colon, or rectum, and make echoes. the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. this procedure is also called endosonography. - upper endoscopy : a procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for abnormal areas. an endoscope is inserted through the mouth and passed through the esophagus into the stomach. sometimes the endoscope also is passed from the stomach into the small intestine. an endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. it may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease. - colonoscopy : a procedure to look inside the rectum and colon for polyps, abnormal areas, or cancer. a colonoscope is inserted through the rectum into the colon. a colonoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. it may also have a tool to remove polyps or tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. - capsule endoscopy : a procedure used to see all of the small intestine. the patient swallows a capsule that contains a tiny camera. as the capsule moves through the gastrointestinal tract, the camera takes pictures and sends them to a receiver worn on the outside of the body. - biopsy : the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. tissue samples may be taken during endoscopy and colonoscopy."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for adult soft tissue sarcoma ?,"patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials."
what is the outlook for breast cancer ?,"certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following: - the stage of the cancer (the size of the tumor and whether it is in the breast only or has spread to lymph nodes or other places in the body). - the type of breast cancer. - estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor levels in the tumor tissue. - human epidermal growth factor type 2 receptor (her2/neu) levels in the tumor tissue. - whether the tumor tissue is triple negative (cells that do not have estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, or high levels of her2/neu). - how fast the tumor is growing. - how likely the tumor is to recur (come back). - a womans age, general health, and menopausal status (whether a woman is still having menstrual periods). - whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back)."
how to diagnose prostate cancer ?,"tests that examine the prostate and blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose prostate cancer. the following tests and procedures may be used: - physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. - digital rectal exam (dre): an exam of the rectum. the doctor or nurse inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum and feels the prostate through the rectal wall for lumps or abnormal areas. - prostate-specific antigen (psa) test : a test that measures the level of psa in the blood. psa is a substance made by the prostate that may be found in an increased amount in the blood of men who have prostate cancer. psa levels may also be high in men who have an infection or inflammation of the prostate or bph (an enlarged, but noncancerous, prostate). - transrectal ultrasound : a procedure in which a probe that is about the size of a finger is inserted into the rectum to check the prostate. the probe is used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. transrectal ultrasound may be used during a biopsy procedure. - transrectal magnetic resonance imaging (mri): a procedure that uses a strong magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. a probe that gives off radio waves is inserted into the rectum near the prostate. this helps the mri machine make clearer pictures of the prostate and nearby tissue. a transrectal mri is done to find out if the cancer has spread outside the prostate into nearby tissues. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri). - biopsy: the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist. the pathologist will check the tissue sample to see if there are cancer cells and find out the gleason score. the gleason score ranges from 2-10 and describes how likely it is that a tumor will spread. the lower the number, the less likely the tumor is to spread. a transrectal biopsy is used to diagnose prostate cancer. a transrectal biopsy is the removal of tissue from the prostate by inserting a thin needle through the rectum and into the prostate. this procedure is usually done using transrectal ultrasound to help guide where samples of tissue are taken from. a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells."

(see the general information section.) in prostate cancer, staging tests may not be done unless the patient has symptoms or signs that the cancer has spread, such as bone pain, a high psa level, or a high gleason score. the following tests and procedures also may be used in the staging process: - bone scan : a procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. a very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. the radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner. - mri (magnetic resonance imaging): a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri). - ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. - pelvic lymphadenectomy : a surgical procedure to remove the lymph nodes in the pelvis. a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. - seminal vesicle biopsy : the removal of fluid from the seminal vesicles (glands that make semen) using a needle. a pathologist views the fluid under a microscope to look for cancer cells. - prostascint scan : a procedure to check for cancer that has spread from the prostate to other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes. a very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. the radioactive material attaches to prostate cancer cells and is detected by a scanner. the radioactive material shows up as a bright spot on the picture in areas where there are a lot of prostate cancer cells. the stage of the cancer is based on the results of the staging and diagnostic tests, including the prostate-specific antigen (psa) test and the gleason score. the tissue samples removed during the biopsy are used to find out the gleason score. the gleason score ranges from 2-10 and describes how different the cancer cells look from normal cells and how likely it is that the tumor will spread. the lower the number, the less likely the tumor is to spread. there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: - tissue. the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. - lymph system. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. - blood. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. when cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. - lymph system. the cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. - blood. the cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. for example, if prostate cancer spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually prostate cancer cells. the disease is metastatic prostate cancer, not bone cancer. denosumab, a monoclonal antibody, may be used to prevent bone metastases. the following stages are used for prostate cancer: stage i in stage i, cancer is found in the prostate only. the cancer: - is found by needle biopsy (done for a high psa level) or in a small amount of tissue during surgery for other reasons (such as benign prostatic hyperplasia). the psa level is lower than 10 and the gleason score is 6 or lower; or - is found in one-half or less of one lobe of the prostate. the psa level is lower than 10 and the gleason score is 6 or lower; or - cannot be felt during a digital rectal exam and cannot be seen in imaging tests. cancer is found in one-half or less of one lobe of the prostate. the psa level and the gleason score are not known. stage ii in stage ii, cancer is more advanced than in stage i, but has not spread outside the prostate. stage ii is divided into stages iia and iib. in stage iia, cancer: - is found by needle biopsy (done for a high psa level) or in a small amount of tissue during surgery for other reasons (such as benign prostatic hyperplasia). the psa level is lower than 20 and the gleason score is 7; or - is found by needle biopsy (done for a high psa level) or in a small amount of tissue during surgery for other reasons (such as benign prostatic hyperplasia). the psa level is at least 10 but lower than 20 and the gleason score is 6 or lower; or - is found in one-half or less of one lobe of the prostate. the psa level is at least 10 but lower than 20 and the gleason score is 6 or lower; or - is found in one-half or less of one lobe of the prostate. the psa level is lower than 20 and the gleason score is 7; or - is found in more than one-half of one lobe of the prostate. in stage iib, cancer: - is found in opposite sides of the prostate. the psa can be any level and the gleason score can range from 2 to 10; or - cannot be felt during a digital rectal exam and cannot be seen in imaging tests. the psa level is 20 or higher and the gleason score can range from 2 to 10; or - cannot be felt during a digital rectal exam and cannot be seen in imaging tests. the psa can be any level and the gleason score is 8 or higher. stage iii in stage iii, cancer has spread beyond the outer layer of the prostate and may have spread to the seminal vesicles. the psa can be any level and the gleason score can range from 2 to 10. stage iv in stage iv, the psa can be any level and the gleason score can range from 2 to 10. also, cancer: - has spread beyond the seminal vesicles to nearby tissue or organs, such as the rectum, bladder, or pelvic wall; or - may have spread to the seminal vesicles or to nearby tissue or organs, such as the rectum, bladder, or pelvic wall. cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes; or - has spread to distant parts of the body, which may include lymph nodes or bones. prostate cancer often spreads to the bones."
what is (are) adult non-hodgkin lymphoma ?,"key points - adult non-hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph system. - the major types of lymphoma are hodgkin lymphoma and non-hodgkin lymphoma. - non-hodgkin lymphoma can be indolent or aggressive. - age, gender, and a weakened immune system can affect the risk of adult non-hodgkin lymphoma. - signs and symptoms of adult non-hodgkin lymphoma include swelling in the lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue. - tests that examine the body and lymph system are used to help detect (find) and diagnose adult non-hodgkin lymphoma. - certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. adult non-hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph system. non-hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that forms in the lymph system, which is part of the body's immune system. the immune system protects the body from foreign substances, infection, and diseases. the lymph system is made up of the following: - lymph: colorless, watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system. lymphocytes protect the body against infection and the growth of tumors. there are three types of lymphocytes: - b lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection. also called b cells. most types of non-hodgkin lymphoma begin in b lymphocytes. - t lymphocytes that help b lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection. also called t cells. - natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses. also called nk cells. non-hodgkin lymphoma can begin in b lymphocytes, t lymphocytes, or natural killer cells. lymphocytes can also be found in the blood and also collect in the lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus. - lymph vessels: a network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream. - lymph nodes: small, bean-shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body. clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm, abdomen, pelvis, and groin. - spleen: an organ that makes lymphocytes, filters the blood, stores blood cells, and destroys old blood cells. it is on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach. - thymus: an organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply. the thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone. - tonsils: two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat. the tonsils make lymphocytes. - bone marrow: the soft, spongy tissue in the center of large bones. bone marrow makes white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the stomach, thyroid gland, brain, and skin. cancer can spread to the liver and lungs. non-hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy is rare. non-hodgkin lymphoma in pregnant women is the same as the disease in nonpregnant women of childbearing age. however, treatment is different for pregnant women. this summary includes information on the treatment of non-hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy (see the treatment options for non-hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy section for more information). non-hodgkin lymphoma can occur in both adults and children. treatment for adults is different than treatment for children. (see the pdq summary on childhood non-hodgkin lymphoma treatment for more information.) the major types of lymphoma are hodgkin lymphoma and non-hodgkin lymphoma. lymphomas are divided into two general types: hodgkin lymphoma and non-hodgkin lymphoma. this summary is about the treatment of adult non-hodgkin lymphoma. for information about certain types of lymphoma, see the following pdq summaries: - adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment (lymphoblastic lymphoma) - adult hodgkin lymphoma treatment - aids-related lymphoma treatment - chronic lymphocytic leukemia treatment (small lymphocytic lymphoma) - mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome treatment (cutaneous t-cell lymphoma) - primary cns lymphoma treatment non-hodgkin lymphoma can be indolent or aggressive. non-hodgkin lymphoma grows and spreads at different rates and can be indolent or aggressive. indolent lymphoma tends to grow and spread slowly, and has few signs and symptoms. aggressive lymphoma grows and spreads quickly, and has signs and symptoms that can be severe. the treatments for indolent and aggressive lymphoma are different. this summary is about the following types of non-hodgkin lymphoma: indolent non-hodgkin lymphomas - follicular lymphoma. follicular lymphoma is the most common type of indolent non-hodgkin lymphoma. it is a very slow-growing type of non-hodgkin lymphoma that begins in b lymphocytes. it affects the lymph nodes and may spread to the bone marrow or spleen. most patients with follicular lymphoma are age 50 years and older when they are diagnosed. follicular lymphoma may go away without treatment. the patient is closely watched for signs or symptoms that the disease has come back. treatment is needed if signs or symptoms occur after the cancer disappeared or after initial cancer treatment. sometimes follicular lymphoma can become a more aggressive type of lymphoma, such as diffuse large b-cell lymphoma. - lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. in most cases of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, b lymphocytes that are turning into plasma cells make large amounts of a protein called monoclonal immunoglobulin m (igm) antibody. high levels of igm antibody in the blood cause the blood plasma to thicken. this may cause signs or symptoms such as trouble seeing or hearing, heart problems, shortness of breath, headache, dizziness, and numbness or tingling of the hands and feet. sometimes there are no signs or symptoms of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. it may be found when a blood test is done for another reason. lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma often spreads to the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen. it is also called waldenstrm macroglobulinemia. - marginal zone lymphoma. this type of non-hodgkin lymphoma begins in b lymphocytes in a part of lymph tissue called the marginal zone. there are five different types of marginal zone lymphoma. they are grouped by the type of tissue where the lymphoma formed: - nodal marginal zone lymphoma. nodal marginal zone lymphoma forms in lymph nodes. this type of non-hodgkin lymphoma is rare. it is also called monocytoid b-cell lymphoma. - gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (malt) lymphoma. gastric malt lymphoma usually begins in the stomach. this type of marginal zone lymphoma forms in cells in the mucosa that help make antibodies. patients with gastric malt lymphoma may also have helicobacter gastritis or an autoimmune disease, such as hashimoto thyroiditis or sjgren syndrome. - extragastric malt lymphoma. extragastric malt lymphoma begins outside of the stomach in almost every part of the body including other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, salivary glands, thyroid, lung, skin, and around the eye. this type of marginal zone lymphoma forms in cells in the mucosa that help make antibodies. extragastric malt lymphoma may come back many years after treatment. - mediterranean abdominal lymphoma. this is a type of malt lymphoma that occurs in young adults in eastern mediterranean countries. it often forms in the abdomen and patients may also be infected with bacteria called campylobacter jejuni. this type of lymphoma is also called immunoproliferative small intestinal disease. - splenic marginal zone lymphoma. this type of marginal zone lymphoma begins in the spleen and may spread to the peripheral blood and bone marrow. the most common sign of this type of splenic marginal zone lymphoma is a spleen that is larger than normal. - primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma. this type of non-hodgkin lymphoma is in the skin only. it can be a benign (not cancer) nodule that may go away on its own or it can spread to many places on the skin and need treatment. aggressive non-hodgkin lymphomas - diffuse large b-cell lymphoma. diffuse large b-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-hodgkin lymphoma. it grows quickly in the lymph nodes and often the spleen, liver, bone marrow, or other organs are also affected. signs and symptoms of diffuse large b-cell lymphoma may include fever, recurring night sweats, and weight loss. these are also called b symptoms. primary mediastinal large b-cell lymphoma is a type of diffuse large b-cell lymphoma. - primary mediastinal large b-cell lymphoma. this type of non-hodgkin lymphoma is marked by the overgrowth of fibrous (scar-like) lymph tissue. a tumor most often forms behind the breastbone. it may press on the airways and cause coughing and trouble breathing. most patients with primary mediastinal large b-cell lymphoma are women who are age 30 to 40 years. - follicular large cell lymphoma, stage iii. follicular large cell lymphoma, stage iii, is a very rare type of non-hodgkin lymphoma. it is more like diffuse large b-cell lymphoma than other types of follicular lymphoma. - anaplastic large cell lymphoma. anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a type of non-hodgkin lymphoma that usually begins in t lymphocytes. the cancer cells also have a marker called cd30 on the surface of the cell. there are two types of anaplastic large cell lymphoma: - cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma. this type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma mostly affects the skin, but other parts of the body may also be affected. signs of cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma include one or more bumps or ulcers on the skin. - systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma. this type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma begins in the lymph nodes and may affect other parts of the body. patients may have a lot of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (alk) protein inside the lymphoma cells. these patients have a better prognosis than patients who do not have extra alk protein. systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma is more common in children than adults. (see the pdq summary on childhood non-hodgkin lymphoma treatment for more information.) - extranodal nk -/t-cell lymphoma. extranodal nk-/t-cell lymphoma usually begins in the area around the nose. it may also affect the paranasal sinus (hollow spaces in the bones around the nose), roof of the mouth, trachea, skin, stomach, and intestines. most cases of extranodal nk-/t-cell lymphoma have epstein-barr virus in the tumor cells. sometimes hemophagocytic syndrome occurs (a serious condition in which there are too many active histiocytes and t cells that cause severe inflammation in the body). treatment to suppress the immune system is needed. this type of non-hodgkin lymphoma is not common in the united states. - lymphomatoid granulomatosis. lymphomatoid granulomatosis mostly affects the lungs. it may also affect the paranasal sinuses (hollow spaces in the bones around the nose), skin, kidneys, and central nervous system. in lymphomatoid granulomatosis, cancer invades the blood vessels and kills tissue. because the cancer may spread to the brain, intrathecal chemotherapy or radiation therapy to the brain is given. - angioimmunoblastic t-cell lymphoma. this type of non-hodgkin lymphoma begins in t cells. swollen lymph nodes are a common sign. other signs may include a skin rash, fever, weight loss, or night sweats. there may also be high levels of gamma globulin (antibodies) in the blood. patients may also have opportunistic infections because their immune systems are weakened. - peripheral t-cell lymphoma. peripheral t-cell lymphoma begins in mature t lymphocytes. this type of t lymphocyte matures in the thymus gland and travels to other lymphatic sites in the body such as the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and spleen. there are three subtypes of peripheral t-cell lymphoma: - hepatosplenic t-cell lymphoma. this is an uncommon type of peripheral t-cell lymphoma that occurs mostly in young men. it begins in the liver and spleen and the cancer cells also have a t-cell receptor called gamma/delta on the surface of the cell. - subcutaneous panniculitis-like t-cell lymphoma. subcutaneous panniculitis-like t-cell lymphoma begins in the skin or mucosa. it may occur with hemophagocytic syndrome (a serious condition in which there are too many active histiocytes and t cells that cause severe inflammation in the body). treatment to suppress the immune system is needed. - enteropathy-type intestinal t-cell lymphoma. this type of peripheral t-cell lymphoma occurs in the small bowel of patients with untreated celiac disease (an immune response to gluten that causes malnutrition). patients who are diagnosed with celiac disease in childhood and stay on a gluten-free diet rarely develop enteropathy-type intestinal t-cell lymphoma. - intravascular large b-cell lymphoma. this type of non-hodgkin lymphoma affects blood vessels, especially the small blood vessels in the brain, kidney, lung, and skin. signs and symptoms of intravascular large b-cell lymphoma are caused by blocked blood vessels. it is also called intravascular lymphomatosis. - burkitt lymphoma. burkitt lymphoma is a type of b-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma that grows and spreads very quickly. it may affect the jaw, bones of the face, bowel, kidneys, ovaries, or other organs. there are three main types of burkitt lymphoma (endemic, sporadic, and immunodeficiency related). endemic burkitt lymphoma commonly occurs in africa and is linked to the epstein-barr virus, and sporadic burkitt lymphoma occurs throughout the world. immunodeficiency-related burkitt lymphoma is most often seen in patients who have aids. burkitt lymphoma may spread to the brain and spinal cord and treatment to prevent its spread may be given. burkitt lymphoma occurs most often in children and young adults (see the pdq summary on childhood non-hodgkin lymphoma treatment for more information.) burkitt lymphoma is also called diffuse small noncleaved-cell lymphoma. - lymphoblastic lymphoma. lymphoblastic lymphoma may begin in t cells or b cells, but it usually begins in t cells. in this type of non-hodgkin lymphoma, there are too many lymphoblasts (immature white blood cells) in the lymph nodes and the thymus gland. these lymphoblasts may spread to other places in the body, such as the bone marrow, brain, and spinal cord. lymphoblastic lymphoma is most common in teenagers and young adults. it is a lot like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (lymphoblasts are mostly found in the bone marrow and blood). (see the pdq summary on adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment for more information.) - adult t-cell leukemia/lymphoma. adult t-cell leukemia/lymphoma is caused by the human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1). signs include bone and skin lesions, high blood calcium levels, and lymph nodes, spleen, and liver that are larger than normal. - mantle cell lymphoma. mantle cell lymphoma is a type of b-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma that usually occurs in middle-aged or older adults. it begins in the lymph nodes and spreads to the spleen, bone marrow, blood, and sometimes the esophagus, stomach, and intestines. patients with mantle cell lymphoma have too much of a protein called cyclin-d1 or a certain gene change in the lymphoma cells. in some patients who do not have signs or symptoms of lymphoma delaying the start of treatment does not affect the prognosis. - posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder. this disease occurs in patients who have had a heart, lung, liver, kidney, or pancreas transplant and need lifelong immunosuppressive therapy. most posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders affect the b cells and have epstein-barr virus in the cells. lymphoproliferative disorders are often treated like cancer. - true histiocytic lymphoma. this is a rare, very aggressive type of lymphoma. it is not known whether it begins in b cells or t cells. it does not respond well to treatment with standard chemotherapy. - primary effusion lymphoma. primary effusion lymphoma begins in b cells that are found in an area where there is a large build-up of fluid, such as the areas between the lining of the lung and chest wall (pleural effusion), the sac around the heart and the heart (pericardial effusion), or in the abdominal cavity. there is usually no tumor that can be seen. this type of lymphoma often occurs in patients who have aids. - plasmablastic lymphoma. plasmablastic lymphoma is a type of large b-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma that is very aggressive. it is most often seen in patients with hiv infection."
what are the stages of adult non-hodgkin lymphoma ?,"key points - after adult non-hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body. - there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - stages of adult non-hodgkin lymphoma may include e and s. - the following stages are used for adult non-hodgkin lymphoma: - stage i - stage ii - stage iii - stage iv - adult non-hodgkin lymphomas may be grouped for treatment according to whether the cancer is indolent or aggressive and whether affected lymph nodes are next to each other in the body. after adult non-hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body. the process used to find out the type of cancer and if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body is called staging. the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. it is important to know the stage of the disease in order to plan treatment. the results of the tests and procedures done to diagnose non-hodgkin lymphoma are used to help make decisions about treatment. the following tests and procedures may also be used in the staging process: - complete blood count (cbc) with differential : a procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following: - the number of red blood cells and platelets. - the number and type of white blood cells. - the amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells. - the portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells. - blood chemistry studies : a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. an unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. - ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the lung, lymph nodes, and liver, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. - pet scan (positron emission tomography scan): a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. - mri (magnetic resonance imaging): a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri). - bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : the removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a needle into the hipbone or breastbone. a pathologist views the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer. - lumbar puncture : a procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (csf) from the spinal column. this is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the csf around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid. the sample of csf is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord. this procedure is also called an lp or spinal tap. for pregnant women with non-hodgkin lymphoma, staging tests and procedures that protect the baby from the harms of radiation are used. these tests and procedures include mri, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, lumbar puncture, and ultrasound. an ultrasound exam is a procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: - tissue. the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. - lymph system. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. - blood. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. stages of adult non-hodgkin lymphoma may include e and s. adult non-hodgkin lymphoma may be described as follows: - e: ""e"" stands for extranodal and means the cancer is found in an area or organ other than the lymph nodes or has spread to tissues beyond, but near, the major lymphatic areas. - s: ""s"" stands for spleen and means the cancer is found in the spleen. the following stages are used for adult non-hodgkin lymphoma: stage i stage i adult non-hodgkin lymphoma is divided into stage i and stage ie. - stage i: cancer is found in one lymphatic area (lymph node group, tonsils and nearby tissue, thymus, or spleen). - stage ie: cancer is found in one organ or area outside the lymph nodes. stage ii stage ii adult non-hodgkin lymphoma is divided into stage ii and stage iie. - stage ii: cancer is found in two or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm (the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen). - stage iie: cancer is found in one or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm. cancer is also found outside the lymph nodes in one organ or area on the same side of the diaphragm as the affected lymph nodes. stage iii stage iii adult non-hodgkin lymphoma is divided into stage iii, stage iiie, stage iiis, and stage iiie+s. - stage iii: cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm (the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen). - stage iiie: cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm and outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area. - stage iiis: cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm, and in the spleen. - stage iiie+s: cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm, outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area, and in the spleen. stage iv in stage iv adult non-hodgkin lymphoma, the cancer: - is found throughout one or more organs that are not part of a lymphatic area (lymph node group, tonsils and nearby tissue, thymus, or spleen), and may be in lymph nodes near those organs; or - is found in one organ that is not part of a lymphatic area and has spread to organs or lymph nodes far away from that organ; or - is found in the liver, bone marrow, cerebrospinal fluid (csf), or lungs (other than cancer that has spread to the lungs from nearby areas). adult non-hodgkin lymphomas may be grouped for treatment according to whether the cancer is indolent or aggressive and whether affected lymph nodes are next to each other in the body. see the general information section for more information on the types of indolent (slow-growing) and aggressive (fast-growing) non-hodgkin lymphoma. non-hodgkin lymphoma can also be described as contiguous or noncontiguous: - contiguous lymphomas: lymphomas in which the lymph nodes with cancer are next to each other. - noncontiguous lymphomas: lymphomas in which the lymph nodes with cancer are not next to each other, but are on the same side of the diaphragm."
what is (are) kaposi sarcoma ?,"key points - kaposi sarcoma is a disease in which malignant tumors (cancer) can form in the skin, mucous membranes, lymph nodes, and other organs. - tests that examine the skin, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract are used to detect (find) and diagnose kaposi sarcoma. - after kaposi sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body. - certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. kaposi sarcoma is a disease in which malignant tumors (cancer) can form in the skin, mucous membranes, lymph nodes, and other organs. kaposi sarcoma is a cancer that causes lesions (abnormal tissue) to grow in the skin; the mucous membranes lining the mouth, nose, and throat; lymph nodes; or other organs. the lesions are usually purple and are made of cancer cells, new blood vessels, red blood cells, and white blood cells. kaposi sarcoma is different from other cancers in that lesions may begin in more than one place in the body at the same time. human herpesvirus-8 (hhv-8) is found in the lesions of all patients with kaposi sarcoma. this virus is also called kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (kshv). most people infected with hhv-8 do not get kaposi sarcoma. those infected with hhv-8 who are most likely to develop kaposi sarcoma have immune systems weakened by disease or by drugs given after an organ transplant. there are several types of kaposi sarcoma, including: - classic kaposi sarcoma. - african kaposi sarcoma. - immunosuppressive therapyrelated kaposi sarcoma. - epidemic kaposi sarcoma. - nonepidemic kaposi sarcoma. tests that examine the skin, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract are used to detect (find) and diagnose kaposi sarcoma. the following tests and procedures may be used: - physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking skin and lymph nodes for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. - chest x-ray : an x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. an x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. this is used to find kaposi sarcoma in the lungs. - biopsy : the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. one of the following types of biopsies may be done to check for kaposi sarcoma lesions in the skin: - excisional biopsy : a scalpel is used to remove the entire skin growth. - incisional biopsy : a scalpel is used to remove part of a skin growth. - core biopsy : a wide needle is used to remove part of a skin growth. - fine-needle aspiration (fna) biopsy : a thin needle is used to remove part of a skin growth. an endoscopy or bronchoscopy may be done to check for kaposi sarcoma lesions in the gastrointestinal tract or lungs. - endoscopy for biopsy: a procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for abnormal areas. an endoscope is inserted through an incision (cut) in the skin or opening in the body, such as the mouth. an endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. it may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease. this is used to find kaposi sarcoma lesions in the gastrointestinal tract. - bronchoscopy for biopsy: a procedure to look inside the trachea and large airways in the lung for abnormal areas. a bronchoscope is inserted through the nose or mouth into the trachea and lungs. a bronchoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. it may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease. this is used to find kaposi sarcoma lesions in the lungs. after kaposi sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body. the following tests and procedures may be used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body: - blood chemistry studies : a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. an unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. - ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the lung, liver, and spleen, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. - pet scan (positron emission tomography scan): a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. this imaging test checks for signs of cancer in the lung, liver, and spleen. - cd34 lymphocyte count: a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of cd34 cells (a type of white blood cell). a lower than normal amount of cd34 cells can be a sign the immune system is not working well. certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following: - the type of kaposi sarcoma. - the general health of the patient, especially the patient's immune system. - whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back). classic kaposi sarcoma key points - classic kaposi sarcoma is found most often in older men of italian or eastern european jewish origin. - signs of classic kaposi sarcoma may include slow-growing lesions on the legs and feet. - another cancer may develop. classic kaposi sarcoma is found most often in older men of italian or eastern european jewish origin. classic kaposi sarcoma is a rare disease that gets worse slowly over many years. signs of classic kaposi sarcoma may include slow-growing lesions on the legs and feet. patients may have one or more red, purple, or brown skin lesions on the legs and feet, most often on the ankles or soles of the feet. over time, lesions may form in other parts of the body, such as the stomach, intestines, or lymph nodes. the lesions usually don't cause any symptoms, but may grow in size and number over a period of 10 years or more. pressure from the lesions may block the flow of lymph and blood in the legs and cause painful swelling. lesions in the digestive tract may cause gastrointestinal bleeding. another cancer may develop. some patients with classic kaposi sarcoma may develop another type of cancer before the kaposi sarcoma lesions appear or later in life. most often, this second cancer is non-hodgkin lymphoma. frequent follow-up is needed to watch for these second cancers. epidemic kaposi sarcoma key points - epidemic kaposi sarcoma is found in patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). - signs of epidemic kaposi sarcoma can include lesions that form in many parts of the body. - the use of drug therapy called cart reduces the risk of epidemic kaposi sarcoma in patients infected with hiv. epidemic kaposi sarcoma is found in patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). epidemic kaposi sarcoma occurs in patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). aids is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), which attacks and weakens the immune system. when the body's immune system is weakened by hiv, infections and cancers such as kaposi sarcoma can develop. most cases of epidemic kaposi sarcoma in the united states have been diagnosed in homosexual or bisexual men infected with hiv. signs of epidemic kaposi sarcoma can include lesions that form in many parts of the body. the signs of epidemic kaposi sarcoma can include lesions in different parts of the body, including any of the following: - skin. - lining of the mouth. - lymph nodes. - stomach and intestines. - lungs and lining of the chest. - liver. - spleen. kaposi sarcoma is sometimes found in the lining of the mouth during a regular dental check-up. in most patients with epidemic kaposi sarcoma, the disease will spread to other parts of the body over time. fever, weight loss, or diarrhea can occur. in the later stages of epidemic kaposi sarcoma, life-threatening infections are common. the use of drug therapy called cart reduces the risk of epidemic kaposi sarcoma in patients infected with hiv. combined antiretroviral therapy (cart) is a combination of several drugs that block hiv and slow down the development of aids and aids-related kaposi sarcoma. for information about aids and its treatment, see the aidsinfo website. tests that examine the skin, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract are used to detect (find) and diagnose kaposi sarcoma. the following tests and procedures may be used: - physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking skin and lymph nodes for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. - chest x-ray : an x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. an x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. this is used to find kaposi sarcoma in the lungs. - biopsy : the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. one of the following types of biopsies may be done to check for kaposi sarcoma lesions in the skin: - excisional biopsy : a scalpel is used to remove the entire skin growth. - incisional biopsy : a scalpel is used to remove part of a skin growth. - core biopsy : a wide needle is used to remove part of a skin growth. -

what is (are) chronic lymphocytic leukemia ?,"key points - chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). - leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. - older age can affect the risk of developing chronic lymphocytic leukemia. - signs and symptoms of chronic lymphocytic leukemia include swollen lymph nodes and tiredness. - tests that examine the blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes are used to detect (find) and diagnose chronic lymphocytic leukemia. - certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery). chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). chronic lymphocytic leukemia (also called cll) is a blood and bone marrow disease that usually gets worse slowly. cll is one of the most common types of leukemia in adults. it often occurs during or after middle age; it rarely occurs in children. leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. normally, the body makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time. a blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell. a myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells: - red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body. - white blood cells that fight infection and disease. - platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding. a lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast cell and then one of three types of lymphocytes (white blood cells): - b lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection. - t lymphocytes that help b lymphocytes make antibodies to fight infection. - natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses. in cll, too many blood stem cells become abnormal lymphocytes and do not become healthy white blood cells. the abnormal lymphocytes may also be called leukemia cells. the lymphocytes are not able to fight infection very well. also, as the number of lymphocytes increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. this may cause infection, anemia, and easy bleeding. this summary is about chronic lymphocytic leukemia. see the following pdq summaries for more information about leukemia: - adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment. - childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment. - adult acute myeloid leukemia treatment. - childhood acute myeloid leukemia/other myeloid malignancies treatment. - chronic myelogenous leukemia treatment. - hairy cell leukemia treatment."
who is at risk for chronic lymphocytic leukemia? ?,"older age can affect the risk of developing chronic lymphocytic leukemia. anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. risk factors for cll include the following: - being middle-aged or older, male, or white. - a family history of cll or cancer of the lymph system. - having relatives who are russian jews or eastern european jews."
what is (are) adult central nervous system tumors ?,"key points - an adult central nervous system tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissues of the brain and/or spinal cord. - a tumor that starts in another part of the body and spreads to the brain is called a metastatic brain tumor. - the brain controls many important body functions. - the spinal cord connects the brain to nerves in most parts of the body. - there are different types of brain and spinal cord tumors. - astrocytic tumors - oligodendroglial tumors - mixed gliomas - ependymal tumors - medulloblastomas - pineal parenchymal tumors - meningeal tumors - germ cell tumors - craniopharyngioma (grade i) - having certain genetic syndromes may increase the risk of a central nervous system tumor. - the cause of most adult brain and spinal cord tumors is not known. - the signs and symptoms of adult brain and spinal cord tumors are not the same in every person. - tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to diagnose adult brain and spinal cord tumors. - a biopsy is also used to diagnose a brain tumor. - sometimes a biopsy or surgery cannot be done. - certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. an adult central nervous system tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissues of the brain and/or spinal cord. there are many types of brain and spinal cord tumors. the tumors are formed by the abnormal growth of cells and may begin in different parts of the brain or spinal cord. together, the brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system (cns). the tumors may be either benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer): - benign brain and spinal cord tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain. they rarely spread into other tissues and may recur (come back). - malignant brain and spinal cord tumors are likely to grow quickly and spread into other brain tissue. when a tumor grows into or presses on an area of the brain, it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should. both benign and malignant brain tumors cause signs and symptoms and need treatment. brain and spinal cord tumors can occur in both adults and children. however, treatment for children may be different than treatment for adults. (see the pdq summary on childhood brain and spinal cord tumors treatment overview for more information on the treatment of children.) for information about lymphoma that begins in the brain, see the pdq summary on primary cns lymphoma treatment. a tumor that starts in another part of the body and spreads to the brain is called a metastatic brain tumor. tumors that start in the brain are called primary brain tumors. primary brain tumors may spread to other parts of the brain or to the spine. they rarely spread to other parts of the body. often, tumors found in the brain have started somewhere else in the body and spread to one or more parts of the brain. these are called metastatic brain tumors (or brain metastases). metastatic brain tumors are more common than primary brain tumors. up to half of metastatic brain tumors are from lung cancer. other types of cancer that commonly spread to the brain include: - melanoma. - breast cancer. - colon cancer. - kidney cancer. - nasopharyngeal cancer. - cancer of unknown primary site. cancer may spread to the leptomeninges (the two innermost membranes covering the brain and spinal cord). this is called leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. the most common cancers that spread to the leptomeninges include: - breast cancer. - lung cancer. - leukemia. - lymphoma. see the following for more information from pdq about cancers that commonly spread to the brain or spinal cord: - adult hodgkin lymphoma treatment - adult non-hodgkin lymphoma treatment - breast cancer treatment - carcinoma of unknown primary treatment - colon cancer treatment - leukemia home page - melanoma treatment - nasopharyngeal cancer treatment - non-small cell lung cancer treatment - renal cell cancer treatment - small cell lung cancer treatment the brain controls many important body functions. the brain has three major parts: - the cerebrum is the largest part of the brain. it is at the top of the head. the cerebrum controls thinking, learning, problem solving, emotions, speech, reading, writing, and voluntary movement. - the cerebellum is in the lower back of the brain (near the middle of the back of the head). it controls movement, balance, and posture. - the brain stem connects the brain to the spinal cord. it is in the lowest part of the brain (just above the back of the neck). the brain stem controls breathing, heart rate, and the nerves and muscles used to see, hear, walk, talk, and eat. the spinal cord connects the brain to nerves in most parts of the body. the spinal cord is a column of nerve tissue that runs from the brain stem down the center of the back. it is covered by three thin layers of tissue called membranes. these membranes are surrounded by the vertebrae (back bones). spinal cord nerves carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body, such as a message from the brain to cause muscles to move or a message from the skin to the brain to feel touch. there are different types of brain and spinal cord tumors. brain and spinal cord tumors are named based on the type of cell they formed in and where the tumor first formed in the cns. the grade of a tumor may be used to tell the difference between slow-growing and fast-growing types of the tumor. the world health organization (who) tumor grades are based on how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread. who tumor grading system - grade i (low-grade) the tumor cells look more like normal cells under a microscope and grow and spread more slowly than grade ii, iii, and iv tumor cells. they rarely spread into nearby tissues. grade i brain tumors may be cured if they are completely removed by surgery. - grade ii the tumor cells grow and spread more slowly than grade iii and iv tumor cells. they may spread into nearby tissue and may recur (come back). some tumors may become a higher-grade tumor. - grade iii the tumor cells look very different from normal cells under a microscope and grow more quickly than grade i and ii tumor cells. they are likely to spread into nearby tissue. - grade iv (high-grade) the tumor cells do not look like normal cells under a microscope and grow and spread very quickly. there may be areas of dead cells in the tumor. grade iv tumors usually cannot be cured. the following types of primary tumors can form in the brain or spinal cord: astrocytic tumors an astrocytic tumor begins in star-shaped brain cells called astrocytes, which help keep nerve cells healthy. an astrocyte is a type of glial cell. glial cells sometimes form tumors called gliomas. astrocytic tumors include the following: - brain stem glioma (usually high grade): a brain stem glioma forms in the brain stem, which is the part of the brain connected to the spinal cord. it is often a high-grade tumor, which spreads widely through the brain stem and is hard to cure. brain stem gliomas are rare in adults. (see the pdq summary on childhood brain stem glioma treatment for more information.) - pineal astrocytic tumor (any grade): a pineal astrocytic tumor forms in tissue around the pineal gland and may be any grade. the pineal gland is a tiny organ in the brain that makes melatonin, a hormone that helps control the sleeping and waking cycle. - pilocytic astrocytoma (grade i): a pilocytic astrocytoma grows slowly in the brain or spinal cord. it may be in the form of a cyst and rarely spreads into nearby tissues. pilocytic astrocytomas can often be cured. - diffuse astrocytoma (grade ii): a diffuse astrocytoma grows slowly, but often spreads into nearby tissues. the tumor cells look something like normal cells. in some cases, a diffuse astrocytoma can be cured. it is also called a low-grade diffuse astrocytoma. - anaplastic astrocytoma (grade iii): an anaplastic astrocytoma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. the tumor cells look different from normal cells. this type of tumor usually cannot be cured. an anaplastic astrocytoma is also called a malignant astrocytoma or high-grade astrocytoma. - glioblastoma (grade iv): a glioblastoma grows and spreads very quickly. the tumor cells look very different from normal cells. this type of tumor usually cannot be cured. it is also called glioblastoma multiforme. see the pdq summary on childhood astrocytomas treatment for more information about astrocytomas in children. oligodendroglial tumors an oligodendroglial tumor begins in brain cells called oligodendrocytes, which help keep nerve cells healthy. an oligodendrocyte is a type of glial cell. oligodendrocytes sometimes form tumors called oligodendrogliomas. grades of oligodendroglial tumors include the following: - oligodendroglioma (grade ii): an oligodendroglioma grows slowly, but often spreads into nearby tissues. the tumor cells look something like normal cells. in some cases, an oligodendroglioma can be cured. - anaplastic oligodendroglioma (grade iii): an anaplastic oligodendroglioma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. the tumor cells look different from normal cells. this type of tumor usually cannot be cured. see the pdq summary on childhood astrocytomas treatment for more information about oligodendroglial tumors in children. mixed gliomas a mixed glioma is a brain tumor that has two types of tumor cells in it oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. this type of mixed tumor is called an oligoastrocytoma. - oligoastrocytoma (grade ii): an oligoastrocytoma is a slow-growing tumor. the tumor cells look something like normal cells. in some cases, an oligoastrocytoma can be cured. - anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (grade iii): an anaplastic oligoastrocytoma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. the tumor cells look different from normal cells. this type of tumor has a worse prognosis than oligoastrocytoma (grade ii). see the pdq summary on childhood astrocytomas treatment for more information about mixed gliomas in children. ependymal tumors an ependymal tumor usually begins in cells that line the fluid -filled spaces in the brain and around the spinal cord. an ependymal tumor may also be called an ependymoma. grades of ependymomas include the following: - ependymoma (grade i or ii): a grade i or ii ependymoma grows slowly and has cells that look something like normal cells. there are two types of grade i ependymoma myxopapillary ependymoma and subependymoma. a grade ii ependymoma grows in a ventricle (fluid-filled space in the brain) and its connecting paths or in the spinal cord. in some cases, a grade i or ii ependymoma can be cured. - anaplastic ependymoma (grade iii): an anaplastic ependymoma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. the tumor cells look different from normal cells. this type of tumor usually has a worse prognosis than a grade i or ii ependymoma. see the pdq summary on childhood ependymoma treatment for more information about ependymoma in children. medulloblastomas a medulloblastoma is a type of embryonal tumor. medulloblastomas are most common in children or young adults. see the pdq summary on childhood central nervous system embryonal tumors treatment for more information about medulloblastomas in children. pineal parenchymal tumors a pineal parenchymal tumor forms in parenchymal cells or pineocytes, which are the cells that make up most of the pineal gland. these tumors are different from pineal astrocytic tumors. grades of pineal parenchymal tumors include the following: - pineocytoma (grade ii): a pineocytoma is a slow-growing pineal tumor. - pineoblastoma (grade iv): a pineoblastoma is a rare tumor that is very likely to spread. see the pdq summary on childhood central nervous system embryonal tumors treatment for more information about pineal parenchymal tumors in children. meningeal tumors a meningeal tumor, also called a meningioma, forms in the meninges (thin layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord). it can form from different types of brain or spinal cord cells. meningiomas are most common in adults. types of meningeal tumors include the following: - meningioma (grade i): a grade i meningioma is the most common type of meningeal tumor. a grade i meningioma is a slow-growing tumor. it forms most often in the dura mater. a grade i meningioma can be cured if it is completely removed by surgery. - meningioma (grade ii and iii): this is a rare meningeal tumor. it grows quickly and is likely to spread within the brain and spinal cord. the prognosis is worse than a grade i meningioma because the tumor usually cannot be completely removed by surgery. a hemangiopericytoma is not a meningeal tumor but is treated like a grade ii or iii meningioma. a hemangiopericytoma usually forms in the dura mater. the prognosis is worse than a grade i meningioma because the tumor usually cannot be completely removed by surgery. germ cell tumors a germ cell tumor forms in germ cells, which are the cells that develop into sperm in men or ova (eggs) in women. there are different types of germ cell tumors. these include germinomas, teratomas, embryonal yolk sac carcinomas, and choriocarcinomas. germ cell tumors can be either benign or malignant. see the pdq summary on childhood central nervous system germ cell tumors treatment for more information about childhood germ cell tumors in the brain. craniopharyngioma (grade i) a craniopharyngioma is a rare tumor that usually forms in the center of the brain just above the pituitary gland (a pea-sized organ at the bottom of the brain that controls other glands). craniopharyngiomas can form from different types of brain or spinal cord cells. see the pdq summary on childhood craniopharyngioma treatment for more information about craniopharyngioma in children."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for adult central nervous system tumors ?,"new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. this summary section refers to new treatments being studied in clinical trials, but it may not mention every new treatment being studied. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. proton beam radiation therapy proton beam radiation therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of protons (small, positively-charged pieces of matter) to make radiation. this type of radiation kills tumor cells with little damage to nearby tissues. it is used to treat cancers of the head, neck, and spine and organs such as the brain, eye, lung, and prostate. proton beam radiation is different from x-ray radiation. biologic therapy biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy. biologic therapy is being studied for the treatment of some types of brain tumors. treatments may include the following: - dendritic cell vaccine therapy. - gene therapy. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials."

what are the symptoms of gastrointestinal stromal tumors ?,"signs of gastrointestinal stromal tumors include blood in the stool or vomit. these and other signs and symptoms may be caused by a gist or by other conditions. check with your doctor if you have any of the following: - blood (either bright red or very dark) in the stool or vomit. - pain in the abdomen, which may be severe. - feeling very tired. - trouble or pain when swallowing. - feeling full after only a little food is eaten."
what are the treatments for gastrointestinal stromal tumors ?,"key points - there are different types of treatment for patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors. - four types of standard treatment are used: - surgery - targeted therapy - watchful waiting - supportive care - new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - follow-up tests may be needed. there are different types of treatment for patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors. different types of treatments are available for patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (gists). some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. four types of standard treatment are used: surgery if the gist has not spread and is in a place where surgery can be safely done, the tumor and some of the tissue around it may be removed. sometimes surgery is done using a laparoscope (a thin, lighted tube) to see inside the body. small incisions (cuts) are made in the wall of the abdomen and a laparoscope is inserted into one of the incisions. instruments may be inserted through the same incision or through other incisions to remove organs or tissues. targeted therapy targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis) are targeted therapy drugs that block signals needed for tumors to grow. tkis may be used to treat gists that cannot be removed by surgery or to shrink gists so they become small enough to be removed by surgery. imatinib mesylate and sunitinib are two tkis used to treat gists. tkis are sometimes given for as long as the tumor does not grow and serious side effects do not occur. see drugs approved for gastrointestinal stromal tumors for more information. watchful waiting watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. supportive care if a gist gets worse during treatment or there are side effects, supportive care is usually given. the goal of supportive care is to prevent or treat the symptoms of a disease, side effects caused by treatment, and psychological, social, and spiritual problems related to a disease or its treatment. supportive care helps improve the quality of life of patients who have a serious or life-threatening disease. radiation therapy is sometimes given as supportive care to relieve pain in patients with large tumors that have spread. new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials. follow-up tests may be needed. some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. follow-up for gists that were removed by surgery may include ct scan of the liver and pelvis or watchful waiting. for gists that are treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, follow-up tests, such as ct, mri, or pet scans, may be done to check how well the targeted therapy is working. treatment options for gastrointestinal stromal tumors resectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors resectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors (gists) can be completely or almost completely removed by surgery. treatment may include the following: - surgery to remove tumors that are 2 centimeters or larger. laparoscopic surgery may be done if the tumor is 5 cm or smaller. if there are cancer cells remaining at the edges of the area where the tumor was removed, watchful waiting or targeted therapy with imatinib mesylate may follow. - a clinical trial of targeted therapy with imatinib mesylate following surgery, to decrease the chance the tumor will recur (come back). unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors unresectable gists cannot be completely removed by surgery because they are too large or in a place where there would be too much damage to nearby organs if the tumor is removed. treatment is usually a clinical trial of targeted therapy with imatinib mesylate to shrink the tumor, followed by surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible. metastatic and recurrent gastrointestinal stromal tumors treatment of gists that are metastatic (spread to other parts of the body) or recurrent (came back after treatment) may include the following: - targeted therapy with imatinib mesylate. - targeted therapy with sunitinib, if the tumor begins to grow during imatinib mesylate therapy or if the side effects are too bad. - surgery to remove tumors that have been treated with targeted therapy and are shrinking, stable (not changing), or that have slightly increased in size. targeted therapy may continue after surgery. - surgery to remove tumors when there are serious complications, such as bleeding, a hole in the gastrointestinal (gi) tract, a blocked gi tract, or infection. - a clinical trial of a new treatment. refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumors many gists treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (tki) become refractory (stop responding) to the drug after a while. treatment is usually a clinical trial with a different tki or a clinical trial of a new drug. treatment options in clinical trials check the list of nci-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor. for more specific results, refine the search by using other search features, such as the location of the trial, the type of treatment, or the name of the drug. talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you. general information about clinical trials is available from the nci website."
what is (are) adult primary liver cancer ?,"key points - adult primary liver cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the liver. - there are two types of adult primary liver cancer. - having hepatitis or cirrhosis can affect the risk of adult primary liver cancer. - signs and symptoms of adult primary liver cancer include a lump or pain on the right side. - tests that examine the liver and the blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose adult primary liver cancer. - certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. adult primary liver cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the liver. the liver is one of the largest organs in the body. it has four lobes and fills the upper right side of the abdomen inside the rib cage. three of the many important functions of the liver are: - to filter harmful substances from the blood so they can be passed from the body in stools and urine. - to make bile to help digest fat that comes from food. - to store glycogen (sugar), which the body uses for energy. there are two types of adult primary liver cancer. the two types of adult primary liver cancer are: - hepatocellular carcinoma. - cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). (see the pdq summary on bile duct cancer treatment for more information.) the most common type of adult primary liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma. this type of liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. this summary is about the treatment of primary liver cancer (cancer that begins in the liver). treatment of cancer that begins in other parts of the body and spreads to the liver is not covered in this summary. primary liver cancer can occur in both adults and children. however, treatment for children is different than treatment for adults. (see the pdq summary on childhood liver cancer treatment for more information.)"
who is at risk for adult primary liver cancer? ?,"having hepatitis or cirrhosis can affect the risk of adult primary liver cancer. anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. the following are risk factors for adult primary liver cancer: - having hepatitis b or hepatitis c. having both hepatitis b and hepatitis c increases the risk even more. - having cirrhosis, which can be caused by: - hepatitis (especially hepatitis c); or - drinking large amounts of alcohol for many years or being an alcoholic. - having metabolic syndrome, a set of conditions that occur together, including extra fat around the abdomen, high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high levels of triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoproteins in the blood. - having liver injury that is long-lasting, especially if it leads to cirrhosis. - having hemochromatosis, a condition in which the body takes up and stores more iron than it needs. the extra iron is stored in the liver, heart, and pancreas - eating foods tainted with aflatoxin (poison from a fungus that can grow on foods, such as grains and nuts, that have not been stored properly)."
what is the outlook for adult primary liver cancer ?,"certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following: - the stage of the cancer (the size of the tumor, whether it affects part or all of the liver, or has spread to other places in the body). - how well the liver is working. - the patients general health, including whether there is cirrhosis of the liver."
what are the treatments for childhood central nervous system embryonal tumors ?,"key points - there are different types of treatment for children who have central nervous system (cns) embryonal tumors. - children who have cns embryonal tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating brain tumors in children. - childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years. - some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended. - five types of treatment are used: - surgery - radiation therapy - chemotherapy - high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue - targeted therapy - new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - follow-up tests may be needed. there are different types of treatment for children who have central nervous system (cns) embryonal tumors. different types of treatment are available for children with central nervous system (cns) embryonal tumors. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. children who have cns embryonal tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating brain tumors in children. treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. the pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with brain tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. these may include the following specialists: - pediatrician. - neurosurgeon. - neurologist. - neuropathologist. - neuroradiologist. - rehabilitation specialist. - radiation oncologist. - psychologist. childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years. signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years. it is important to talk with your child's doctors about signs or symptoms caused by the tumor that may continue after treatment. some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended. side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. late effects of cancer treatment may include the following: - physical problems. - changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory. - second cancers (new types of cancer). children diagnosed with medulloblastoma may have certain problems after surgery or radiation therapy such as changes in the ability to think, learn, and pay attention. also, cerebellar mutism syndrome may occur after surgery. signs of this syndrome include the following: - delayed ability to speak. - trouble swallowing and eating. - loss of balance, trouble walking, and worsening handwriting. - loss of muscle tone. - mood swings and changes in personality. some late effects may be treated or controlled. it is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (see the pdq summary on late effects of treatment for childhood cancer for more information). five types of treatment are used: surgery surgery is used to diagnose and treat a childhood cns embryonal tumor as described in the general information section of this summary. even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy: - external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. these types of radiation therapy include the following: - conformal radiation therapy: conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-d) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor. this allows a high dose of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue. - stereotactic radiation therapy: stereotactic radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy. a rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment. a machine aims radiation directly at the tumor, causing less damage to nearby healthy tissue. the total dose of radiation is divided into several smaller doses given over several days. this procedure is also called stereotactic external-beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy. - internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. radiation therapy to the brain can affect growth and development in young children. for this reason, clinical trials are studying new ways of giving radiation that may have fewer side effects than standard methods. the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated. external radiation therapy is used to treat childhood cns embryonal tumors. because radiation therapy can affect growth and brain development in young children, especially children who are three years old or younger, chemotherapy may be given to delay or reduce the need for radiation therapy. chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated. regular dose anticancer drugs given by mouth or vein to treat central nervous system tumors cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. instead, an anticancer drug is injected into the fluid-filled space to kill cancer cells that may have spread there. this is called intrathecal or intraventricular chemotherapy. high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. after the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. these reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the bodys blood cells. targeted therapy targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells. targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. signal transduction inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy used to treat recurrent medulloblastoma. signal transduction inhibitors block signals that are passed from one molecule to another inside a cell. blocking these signals may kill cancer cells. vismodegib is a type of signal transduction inhibitor. new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials. follow-up tests may be needed. some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. (see the general information section for a list of tests.) some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. this is sometimes called re-staging. some of the imaging tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the brain tumor has recurred (come back). if the imaging tests show abnormal tissue in the brain, a biopsy may also be done to find out if the tissue is made up of dead tumor cells or if new cancer cells are growing. these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. treatment options for childhood central nervous system embryonal tumors and childhood pineoblastoma newly diagnosed childhood medulloblastoma in newly diagnosed childhood medulloblastoma, the tumor itself has not been treated. the child may have received drugs or treatment to relieve signs or symptoms caused by the tumor. children older than 3 years with average-risk medulloblastoma standard treatment of average-risk medulloblastoma in children older than 3 years includes the following: -

what is (are) chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms ?,"key points - myeloproliferative neoplasms are a group of diseases in which the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. - there are 6 types of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms. - tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect (find) and diagnose chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms. myeloproliferative neoplasms are a group of diseases in which the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. normally, the bone marrow makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time. a blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell. a lymphoid stem cell becomes a white blood cell. a myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells: - red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body. - white blood cells that fight infection and disease. - platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding. in myeloproliferative neoplasms, too many blood stem cells become one or more types of blood cells. the neoplasms usually get worse slowly as the number of extra blood cells increases. there are 6 types of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms. the type of myeloproliferative neoplasm is based on whether too many red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets are being made. sometimes the body will make too many of more than one type of blood cell, but usually one type of blood cell is affected more than the others are. chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms include the following 6 types: - chronic myelogenous leukemia. - polycythemia vera. - primary myelofibrosis (also called chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis). - essential thrombocythemia. - chronic neutrophilic leukemia. - chronic eosinophilic leukemia. these types are described below. chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms sometimes become acute leukemia, in which too many abnormal white blood cells are made."
who is at risk for parathyroid cancer? ?,having certain inherited disorders can increase the risk of developing parathyroid cancer. anything that increases the chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. risk factors for parathyroid cancer include the following rare disorders that are inherited (passed down from parent to child): - familial isolated hyperparathyroidism (fihp). - multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (men1) syndrome. treatment with radiation therapy may increase the risk of developing a parathyroid adenoma.
what are the symptoms of parathyroid cancer ?,"signs and symptoms of parathyroid cancer include weakness, feeling tired, and a lump in the neck. most parathyroid cancer signs and symptoms are caused by the hypercalcemia that develops. signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia include the following: - weakness. - feeling very tired. - nausea and vomiting. - loss of appetite. - weight loss for no known reason. - being much more thirsty than usual. - urinating much more than usual. - constipation. - trouble thinking clearly. other signs and symptoms of parathyroid cancer include the following: - pain in the abdomen, side, or back that doesn't go away. - pain in the bones. - a broken bone. - a lump in the neck. - change in voice such as hoarseness. - trouble swallowing. other conditions may cause the same signs and symptoms as parathyroid cancer. check with your doctor if you have any of these problems."
what is the outlook for parathyroid cancer ?,certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following: - whether the calcium level in the blood can be controlled. - the stage of the cancer. - whether the tumor and the capsule around the tumor can be completely removed by surgery. - the patient's general health.
what are the stages of parathyroid cancer ?,"key points - after parathyroid cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body. - there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - there is no standard staging process for parathyroid cancer. after parathyroid cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body. the process used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body is called staging. the following imaging tests may be used to determine if cancer has spread to other parts of the body such as the lungs, liver, bone, heart, pancreas, or lymph nodes: - ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. - mri (magnetic resonance imaging): a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri). there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: - tissue. the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. - lymph system. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. - blood. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. when cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. - lymph system. the cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. - blood. the cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. for example, if parathyroid cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually parathyroid cancer cells. the disease is metastatic parathyroid cancer, not lung cancer. there is no standard staging process for parathyroid cancer. parathyroid cancer is described as either localized or metastatic: - localized parathyroid cancer is found in a parathyroid gland and may have spread to nearby tissues. - metastatic parathyroid cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver, bone, sac around the heart, pancreas, or lymph nodes."
who is at risk for lip and oral cavity cancer? ?,tobacco and alcohol use can affect the risk of lip and oral cavity cancer. anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. risk factors for lip and oral cavity cancer include the following: - using tobacco products. - heavy alcohol use. - being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time. - being male.
how to prevent prostate cancer ?,"key points - avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer. - the following risk factors may increase the risk of prostate cancer: - age - family history of prostate cancer - race - hormones - vitamin e - folic acid - dairy and calcium - the following protective factors may decrease the risk of prostate cancer: - folate - finasteride and dutasteride - the following have been proven not to affect the risk of prostate cancer, or their effects on prostate cancer risk are not known: - selenium and vitamin e - diet - multivitamins - lycopene - cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer. - new ways to prevent prostate cancer are being studied in clinical trials. avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer. avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise. increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer. the following risk factors may increase the risk of prostate cancer: age prostate cancer is rare in men younger than 50 years of age. the chance of developing prostate cancer increases as men get older. family history of prostate cancer a man whose father, brother, or son has had prostate cancer has a higher-than-average risk of prostate cancer. race prostate cancer occurs more often in african-american men than in white men. african-american men with prostate cancer are more likely to die from the disease than white men with prostate cancer. hormones the prostate needs male hormones to work the way it should. the main male sex hormone is testosterone. testosterone helps the body develop and maintain male sex characteristics. testosterone is changed into dihydrotestosterone (dht) by an enzyme in the body. dht is important for normal prostate growth but can also cause the prostate to get bigger and may play a part in the development of prostate cancer. vitamin e the selenium and vitamin e cancer prevention trial (select) found that vitamin e taken alone increased the risk of prostate cancer. the risk continued even after the men stopped taking vitamin e. folic acid folate is a kind of vitamin b that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans and orange juice. folic acid is a man-made form of folate that is found in vitamin supplements and fortified foods, such as whole-grain breads and cereals. a 10-year study showed that the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took 1 milligram (mg) supplements of folic acid. however, the risk of prostate cancer was lower in men who had enough folate in their diets. dairy and calcium a diet high in dairy foods and calcium may cause a small increase in the risk of prostate cancer. the following protective factors may decrease the risk of prostate cancer: folate folate is a kind of vitamin b that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans and orange juice. folic acid is a man-made form of folate that is found in vitamin supplements and fortified foods, such as whole-grain breads and cereals. a 10-year study showed that the risk of prostate cancer was lower in men who had enough folate in their diets. however, the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took 1 milligram (mg) supplements of folic acid. finasteride and dutasteride finasteride and dutasteride are drugs used to lower the amount of male sex hormones made by the body. these drugs block the enzyme that changes testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (dht). higher than normal levels of dht may play a part in developing prostate cancer. taking finasteride or dutasteride has been shown to lower the risk for prostate cancer, but it is not known if these drugs lower the risk of death from prostate cancer. the prostate cancer prevention trial (pcpt) studied whether the drug finasteride can prevent prostate cancer in healthy men 55 years of age and older. this prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men that took finasteride compared with the group of men that did not. also, the men who took finasteride who did have prostate cancer had more aggressive tumors. the number of deaths from prostate cancer was the same in both groups. men who took finasteride reported more side effects compared with the group of men that did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, and enlarged breasts. the reduction by dutasteride of prostate cancer events trial (reduce) studied whether the drug dutasteride can prevent prostate cancer in men aged 50 to 75 years at higher risk for the disease. this prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men who took dutasteride compared with the group of men that did not. the number of less aggressive prostate cancers was lower, but the number of more aggressive prostate cancers was not. men who took dutasteride reported more side effects than men who did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, less semen, and gynecomastia (enlarged breasts). the following have been proven not to affect the risk of prostate cancer, or their effects on prostate cancer risk are not known: selenium and vitamin e the selenium and vitamin e cancer prevention trial (select) studied whether taking vitamin e and selenium (a mineral) will prevent prostate cancer. the selenium and vitamin e were taken separately or together by healthy men 55 years of age and older (50 years of age and older for african-american men). the study showed that taking selenium alone or selenium and vitamin e together did not decrease the risk of prostate cancer. diet it is not known if decreasing fat or increasing fruits and vegetables in the diet helps decrease the risk of prostate cancer or death from prostate cancer. in the pcpt trial, certain fatty acids increased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer while others decreased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer. multivitamins regular use of multivitamins has not been proven to increase the risk of early or localized prostate cancer. however, a large study showed an increased risk of advanced prostate cancer among men who took multivitamins more than seven times a week. lycopene some studies have shown that a diet high in lycopene may be linked to a decreased risk of prostate cancer, but other studies have not. it has not been proven that taking lycopene supplements decreases the risk of prostate cancer. cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer. cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer. the purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. these may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements. new ways to prevent prostate cancer are being studied in clinical trials. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. information about clinical trials can be found in the clinical trials section of the nci website. check nci's list of cancer clinical trials for prostate cancer prevention trials that are accepting patients."
what are the treatments for childhood craniopharyngioma ?,"key points - there are different types of treatment for children with craniopharyngioma. - children with craniopharyngioma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating brain tumors in children. - childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years. - some treatments for tumors cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended. - five types of treatment are used: - surgery (resection) - surgery and radiation therapy - surgery with cyst drainage - chemotherapy - biologic therapy - patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their treatment. - follow-up tests may be needed. there are different types of treatment for children with craniopharyngioma. different types of treatments are available for children with craniopharyngioma. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with tumors. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. because tumors in children are rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the nci website. choosing the most appropriate treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team. children with craniopharyngioma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating brain tumors in children. treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with tumors. the pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric healthcare providers who are experts in treating children with brain tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. these may include the following specialists: - pediatrician. - neurosurgeon. - radiation oncologist. - neurologist. - endocrinologist. - ophthalmologist. - rehabilitation specialist. - psychologist. - social worker. - nurse specialist. childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years. signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before diagnosis and continue for months or years. it is important to talk with your child's doctors about signs or symptoms caused by the tumor that may continue after treatment. some treatments for tumors cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended. side effects from tumor treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. late effects of tumor treatment may include the following: - physical problems such as seizures. - behavior problems. - changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory. - second cancers (new types of cancer). the following serious physical problems may occur if the pituitary gland, hypothalamus, optic nerves, or carotid artery are affected during surgery or radiation therapy: - obesity. - metabolic syndrome, including fatty liver disease not caused by drinking alcohol. - vision problems, including blindness. - blood vessel problems or stroke. - loss of the ability to make certain hormones. some late effects may be treated or controlled. life-long hormone replacement therapy with several medicines may be needed. it is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects tumor treatment can have on your child. (see the pdq summary on late effects of treatment for childhood cancer for more information). five types of treatment are used: surgery (resection) the way the surgery is done depends on the size of the tumor and where it is in the brain. it also depends on whether the tumor has grown into nearby tissue in a finger-like way and expected late effects after surgery. the types of surgery that may be used to remove all of the tumor that can be seen with the eye include the following: - transsphenoidal surgery: a type of surgery in which the instruments are inserted into part of the brain by going through an incision (cut) made under the upper lip or at the bottom of the nose between the nostrils and then through the sphenoid bone (a butterfly-shaped bone at the base of the skull). - craniotomy: surgery to remove the tumor through an opening made in the skull. sometimes all of the tumor that can be seen is removed in surgery and no further treatment is needed. at other times, it is hard to remove the tumor because it is growing into or pressing on nearby organs. if there is tumor remaining after the surgery, radiation therapy is usually given to kill any tumor cells that are left. treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. surgery and radiation therapy partial resection is used to treat some craniopharyngiomas. it is used to diagnose the tumor, remove fluid from a cyst, and relieve pressure on the optic nerves. if the tumor is near the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, it is not removed. this reduces the number of serious side effects after surgery. partial resection is followed by radiation therapy. radiation therapy is a tumor treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill tumor cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy: - external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the tumor. - internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the tumor. the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of tumor, whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or has come back, and where the tumor formed in the brain. external and internal radiation therapy are used to treat childhood craniopharyngioma. because radiation therapy to the brain can affect growth and development in young children, ways of giving radiation therapy that have fewer side effects are being used. these include: - stereotactic radiosurgery: for very small craniopharyngiomas at the base of the brain, stereotactic radiosurgery may be used. stereotactic radiosurgery is a type of external radiation therapy. a rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment. a machine aims a single large dose of radiation directly at the tumor. this procedure does not involve surgery. it is also called stereotaxic radiosurgery, radiosurgery, and radiation surgery. - intracavitary radiation therapy: intracavitary radiation therapy is a type of internal radiation therapy that may be used in tumors that are part solid mass and part fluid-filled cyst. radioactive material is placed inside the tumor. this type of radiation therapy causes less damage to the nearby hypothalamus and optic nerves. - intensity-modulated proton therapy: a type of radiation therapy that uses streams of protons (tiny particles with a positive charge) to kill tumor cells. a computer is used to target the exact shape and location of the tumor with proton therapy. this type of 3-dimensional radiation therapy may cause less damage to healthy tissue in the brain and other parts of the body. proton radiation is different from x-ray radiation. surgery with cyst drainage surgery may be done to drain tumors that are mostly fluid-filled cysts. this lowers pressure in the brain and relieves symptoms. a catheter (thin tube) is inserted into the cyst and a small container is placed under the skin. the fluid drains into the container and is later removed. sometimes, after the cyst is drained, a drug is put through the catheter into the cyst. this causes the inside wall of the cyst to scar and stops the cyst from making fluid or increases the amount of the time it takes for the fluid to build up again. surgery to remove the tumor may be done after the cyst is drained. chemotherapy chemotherapy is a treatment that uses anticancer drugs to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach tumor cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid or an organ, the drugs mainly affect tumor cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). intracavitary chemotherapy is a type of regional chemotherapy that places drugs directly into a cavity, such as a cyst. it is used for craniopharyngioma that has come back after treatment. biologic therapy biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy. for craniopharyngioma that has come back after treatment, the biologic therapy drug is placed inside the tumor using a catheter (intracavitary) or in a vein (intravenous). patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the medical research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. many of today's standard treatments are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way diseases will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. check the list of nci-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with childhood craniopharyngioma. for more specific results, refine the search by using other search features, such as the location of the trial, the type of treatment, or the name of the drug. talk with your child's doctor about clinical trials that may be right for your child. general information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their treatment. some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients who have not improved. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop a disease from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of treatment. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's clinical trials database. follow-up tests may be needed. some of the tests that were done to diagnose the disease or decide how to treat it may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed. these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. after treatment, follow-up testing with mri will be done for several years to check if the tumor has come back. treatment options for childhood craniopharyngioma newly diagnosed childhood craniopharyngioma treatment of newly diagnosed childhood craniopharyngioma may include the following: - surgery (resection) with or without radiation therapy. - partial resection followed by radiation therapy. - cyst drainage with or without radiation therapy or surgery. check the list of nci-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with childhood craniopharyngioma. for more specific results, refine the search by using other search features, such as the location of the trial, the type of treatment, or the name of the drug. talk with your child's doctor about clinical trials that may be right for your child. general information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. recurrent childhood craniopharyngioma craniopharyngioma may recur (come back) no matter how it was treated the first time. treatment options for recurrent childhood craniopharyngioma depend on the type of treatment that was given when the tumor was first diagnosed and the needs of the child. treatment may include the following: - surgery (resection). - external-beam radiation therapy. - stereotactic radiosurgery. - intracavitary radiation therapy. - intracavitary chemotherapy or intracavitary biologic therapy. - intravenous biologic therapy. - cyst drainage. - a clinical trial of biologic therapy. check the list of nci-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with childhood craniopharyngioma. for more specific results, refine the search by using other search features, such as the location of the trial, the type of treatment, or the name of the drug. talk with your child's doctor about clinical trials that may be right for your child. general information about clinical trials is available from the nci website."

what are the symptoms of ovarian germ cell tumors ?,"signs of ovarian germ cell tumor are swelling of the abdomen or vaginal bleeding after menopause. ovarian germ cell tumors can be hard to diagnose (find) early. often there are no symptoms in the early stages, but tumors may be found during regular gynecologic exams (checkups). check with your doctor if you have either of the following: - swollen abdomen without weight gain in other parts of the body. - bleeding from the vagina after menopause (when you are no longer having menstrual periods)."
what are the symptoms of childhood hodgkin lymphoma ?,"signs of childhood hodgkin lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. these and other signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood hodgkin lymphoma or by other conditions. check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following: - painless, swollen lymph nodes near the collarbone or in the neck, chest, underarm, or groin. - fever for no known reason. - weight loss for no known reason. - night sweats. - fatigue. - anorexia. - itchy skin. - pain in the lymph nodes after drinking alcohol. fever, weight loss, and night sweats are called b symptoms."
how to diagnose childhood hodgkin lymphoma ?,"tests that examine the lymph system are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood hodgkin lymphoma. the following tests and procedures may be used: - physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. - ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the neck, chest, abdomen, or pelvis, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. - pet scan (positron emission tomography scan): a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. sometimes a pet scan and a ct scan are done at the same time. if there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found. - chest x-ray : an x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. an x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. - complete blood count (cbc): a procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following: - the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. - the amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells. - the portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells. - blood chemistry studies : a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. an unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. - sedimentation rate : a procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the rate at which the red blood cells settle to the bottom of the test tube. the sedimentation rate is a measure of how much inflammation is in the body. a higher than normal sedimentation rate may be a sign of lymphoma. also called erythrocyte sedimentation rate, sed rate, or esr. - lymph node biopsy : the removal of all or part of a lymph node. the lymph node may be removed during an image-guided ct scan or a thoracoscopy, mediastinoscopy, or laparoscopy. one of the following types of biopsies may be done: - excisional biopsy : the removal of an entire lymph node. - incisional biopsy : the removal of part of a lymph node. - core biopsy : the removal of tissue from a lymph node using a wide needle. - fine-needle aspiration (fna) biopsy : the removal of tissue from a lymph node using a thin needle. a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells, especially reed-sternberg cells. reed-sternberg cells are common in classical hodgkin lymphoma. the following test may be done on tissue that was removed: - immunophenotyping : a laboratory test used to identify cells, based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell. this test is used to diagnose the specific type of lymphoma by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system."
what are the treatments for childhood hodgkin lymphoma ?,"key points - there are different types of treatment for children with hodgkin lymphoma. - children with hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood cancer. - children and adolescents may have treatment-related side effects that appear months or years after treatment for hodgkin lymphoma. - five types of standard treatment are used: - chemotherapy - radiation therapy - targeted therapy - surgery - high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant - new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - proton beam radiation therapy - patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - follow-up tests may be needed. there are different types of treatment for children with hodgkin lymphoma. different types of treatment are available for children with hodgkin lymphoma. some treatments are standard and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. children with hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood cancer. treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. the pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with hodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. these may include the following specialists: - pediatrician. - medical oncologist /hematologist. - pediatric surgeon. - radiation oncologist. - endocrinologist. - pediatric nurse specialist. - rehabilitation specialist. - psychologist. - social worker. - child-life specialist. the treatment of hodgkin lymphoma in adolescents and young adults may be different than the treatment for children. some adolescents and young adults are treated with an adult treatment regimen. children and adolescents may have treatment-related side effects that appear months or years after treatment for hodgkin lymphoma. some cancer treatments cause side effects that continue or appear months or years after cancer treatment has ended. these are called late effects. because late effects affect health and development, regular follow-up exams are important. late effects of cancer treatment may include: - physical problems that affect the following: - development of sex and reproductive organs. - fertility (ability to have children). - bone and muscle growth and development. - thyroid, heart, or lung function. - teeth, gums, and salivary gland function. - spleen function (increased risk of infection). - changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory. - second cancers (new types of cancer). for female survivors of hodgkin lymphoma, there is an increased risk of breast cancer. this risk depends on the amount of radiation therapy they received to the breast during treatment and the chemotherapy regimen used. the risk of breast cancer is decreased if these female survivors also received radiation therapy to the ovaries. it is suggested that female survivors who received radiation therapy to the breast have a mammogram once a year starting 8 years after treatment or at age 25 years, whichever is later. female survivors of childhood hodgkin lymphoma who have breast cancer have an increased risk of dying from the disease compared to patients with no history of hodgkin lymphoma who have breast cancer. some late effects may be treated or controlled. it is important to talk with your child's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments. (see the pdq summary on late effects of treatment for childhood cancer for more information). five types of standard treatment are used: chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the risk group. for example, children with low-risk hodgkin lymphoma receive fewer cycles of treatment, fewer anticancer drugs, and lower doses of anticancer drugs than children with high-risk lymphoma. see drugs approved for hodgkin lymphoma for more information. radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy: - external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. these types of external radiation therapy include the following: - conformal radiation therapy: conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-d) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor. - intensity-modulated radiation therapy (imrt): imrt is a type of 3-dimensional (3-d) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles. - internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. radiation therapy may be given, based on the childs risk group and chemotherapy regimen. external radiation therapy is used to treat childhood hodgkin lymphoma. the radiation is given only to the lymph nodes or other areas with cancer. internal radiation therapy is not used to treat hodgkin lymphoma. targeted therapy targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. monoclonal antibody therapy and proteasome inhibitor therapy are being used in the treatment of childhood hodgkin lymphoma. monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. these antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. the antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. they may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. in children, rituximab may be used to treat refractory or recurrent hodgkin lymphoma. brentuximab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab are monoclonal antibodies being studied to treat children. proteasome inhibitor therapy is a type of targeted therapy that blocks the action of proteasomes (proteins that remove other proteins the body no longer needs) in cancer cells and may prevent the growth of tumors. bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor used to treat refractory or recurrent childhood hodgkin lymphoma. surgery surgery may be done to remove as much of the tumor as possible for localized nodular lymphocyte -predominant childhood hodgkin lymphoma. high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. after the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. these reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells. see drugs approved for hodgkin lymphoma for more information. new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. it may not mention every new treatment being studied. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. proton beam radiation therapy proton-beam therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of protons (small, positively-charged particles of matter) to make radiation. this type of radiation therapy may help lessen the damage to healthy tissue near the tumor. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials. follow-up tests may be needed. some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. for patients who receive chemotherapy alone, a pet scan may be done 3 weeks or more after treatment ends. for patients who receive radiation therapy last, a pet scan should not be done until 8 to 12 weeks after treatment.

what are the symptoms of penile cancer ?,"signs of penile cancer include sores, discharge, and bleeding. these and other signs may be caused by penile cancer or by other conditions. check with your doctor if you have any of the following: - redness, irritation, or a sore on the penis. - a lump on the penis."
who is at risk for oropharyngeal cancer? ?,"smoking or being infected with human papillomavirus can increase the risk of oropharyngeal cancer. anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. the most common risk factors for oropharyngeal cancer include the following: - a history of smoking cigarettes for more than 10 pack years and other tobacco use. - personal history of head and neck cancer. - heavy alcohol use. - being infected with human papillomavirus (hpv), especially hpv type 16. the number of cases of oropharyngeal cancers linked to hpv infection is increasing. - chewing betel quid, a stimulant commonly used in parts of asia."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for oropharyngeal cancer ?,"new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials."
what is the outlook for primary myelofibrosis ?,"certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for primary myelofibrosis. prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following: - the age of the patient. - the number of abnormal red blood cells and white blood cells. - the number of blasts in the blood. - whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes. - whether the patient has signs such as fever, night sweats, or weight loss."
what is (are) urethral cancer ?,"key points - urethral cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the urethra. - there are different types of urethral cancer that begin in cells that line the urethra. - a history of bladder cancer can affect the risk of urethral cancer. - signs of urethral cancer include bleeding or trouble with urination. - tests that examine the urethra and bladder are used to detect (find) and diagnose urethral cancer. - certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. urethral cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the urethra. the urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to outside the body. in women, the urethra is about 1 inches long and is just above the vagina. in men, the urethra is about 8 inches long, and goes through the prostate gland and the penis to the outside of the body. in men, the urethra also carries semen. urethral cancer is a rare cancer that occurs more often in men than in women. there are different types of urethral cancer that begin in cells that line the urethra. these cancers are named for the types of cells that become malignant (cancer): - squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of urethral cancer. it forms in cells in the part of the urethra near the bladder in women, and in the lining of the urethra in the penis in men. - transitional cell carcinoma forms in the area near the urethral opening in women, and in the part of the urethra that goes through the prostate gland in men. - adenocarcinoma forms in the glands that are around the urethra in both men and women. urethral cancer can metastasize (spread) quickly to tissues around the urethra and is often found in nearby lymph nodes by the time it is diagnosed. a history of bladder cancer can affect the risk of urethral cancer. anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. risk factors for urethral cancer include the following: - having a history of bladder cancer. - having conditions that cause chronic inflammation in the urethra, including: - sexually transmitted diseases (stds), including human papillomavirus (hpv), especially hpv type 16. - frequent urinary tract infections (utis)."
what are the treatments for melanoma ?,"key points - there are different types of treatment for patients with melanoma. - five types of standard treatment are used: - surgery - chemotherapy - radiation therapy - immunotherapy - targeted therapy - new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - treatment for melanoma may cause side effects. - patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - follow-up tests may be needed. there are different types of treatment for patients with melanoma. different types of treatment are available for patients with melanoma. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. five types of standard treatment are used: surgery surgery to remove the tumor is the primary treatment of all stages of melanoma. a wide local excision is used to remove the melanoma and some of the normal tissue around it. skin grafting (taking skin from another part of the body to replace the skin that is removed) may be done to cover the wound caused by surgery. it is important to know whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. lymph node mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy are done to check for cancer in the sentinel lymph node (the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor) during surgery. a radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. the substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. the first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. if cancer cells are found, more lymph nodes will be removed and tissue samples will be checked for signs of cancer. this is called a lymphadenectomy. even if the doctor removes all the melanoma that can be seen at the time of surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. chemotherapy given after surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. surgery to remove cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes, lung, gastrointestinal (gi) tract, bone, or brain may be done to improve the patients quality of life by controlling symptoms. chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). one type of regional chemotherapy is hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion. with this method, anticancer drugs go directly to the arm or leg the cancer is in. the flow of blood to and from the limb is temporarily stopped with a tourniquet. a warm solution with the anticancer drug is put directly into the blood of the limb. this gives a high dose of drugs to the area where the cancer is. the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. see drugs approved for melanoma for more information. radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy: - external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. - internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. external radiation therapy is used to treat melanoma, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. immunotherapy immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or biologic therapy. the following types of immunotherapy are being used in the treatment of melanoma: - immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: some types of immune cells, such as t cells, and some cancer cells have certain proteins, called checkpoint proteins, on their surface that keep immune responses in check. when cancer cells have large amounts of these proteins, they will not be attacked and killed by t cells. immune checkpoint inhibitors block these proteins and the ability of t cells to kill cancer cells is increased. they are used to treat some patients with advanced melanoma or tumors that cannot be removed by surgery. there are two types of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: - ctla-4 inhibitor: ctl4-a is a protein on the surface of t cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check. when ctla-4 attaches to another protein called b7 on a cancer cell, it stops the t cell from killing the cancer cell. ctla-4 inhibitors attach to ctla-4 and allow the t cells to kill cancer cells. ipilimumab is a type of ctla-4 inhibitor. - pd-1 inhibitor: pd-1 is a protein on the surface of t cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check. when pd-1 attaches to another protein called pdl-1 on a cancer cell, it stops the t cell from killing the cancer cell. pd-1 inhibitors attach to pdl-1 and allow the t cells to kill cancer cells. pembrolizumab and nivolumab are types of pd-1 inhibitors. - interferon: interferon affects the division of cancer cells and can slow tumor growth. - interleukin-2 (il-2): il-2 boosts the growth and activity of many immune cells, especially lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). lymphocytes can attack and kill cancer cells. - tumor necrosis factor (tnf) therapy: tnf is a protein made by white blood cells in response to an antigen or infection. tnf is made in the laboratory and used as a treatment to kill cancer cells. it is being studied in the treatment of melanoma. see drugs approved for melanoma for more information. targeted therapy targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells. targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. the following types of targeted therapy are used or being studied in the treatment of melanoma: - signal transduction inhibitor therapy: signal transduction inhibitors block signals that are passed from one molecule to another inside a cell. blocking these signals may kill cancer cells. - vemurafenib, dabrafenib, trametinib, and cobimetinib are signal transduction inhibitors used to treat some patients with advanced melanoma or tumors that cannot be removed by surgery. vemurafenib and dabrafenib block the activity of proteins made by mutant braf genes. trametinib and cobimetinib affect the growth and survival of cancer cells. - oncolytic virus therapy: a type of targeted therapy that is used in the treatment of melanoma. oncolytic virus therapy uses a virus that infects and breaks down cancer cells but not normal cells. radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be given after oncolytic virus therapy to kill more cancer cells. - angiogenesis inhibitors: a type of targeted therapy that is being studied in the treatment of melanoma. angiogenesis inhibitors block the growth of new blood vessels. in cancer treatment, they may be given to prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. new targeted therapies and combinations of therapies are being studied in the treatment of melanoma. see drugs approved for melanoma for more information. new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website treatment for melanoma may cause side effects. for information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, see our side effects page. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials. follow-up tests may be needed. some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. treatment options by stage stage 0 (melanoma in situ) treatment of stage 0 is usually surgery to remove the area of abnormal cells and a small amount of normal tissue around it. check the list of nci-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with stage 0 melanoma. for more specific results, refine the search by using other search features, such as the location of the trial, the type of treatment, or the name of the drug. talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you. general information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. stage i melanoma treatment of stage i melanoma may include the following: -

what is (are) retinoblastoma ?,"key points - retinoblastoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the retina. - retinoblastoma occurs in heritable and nonheritable forms. - treatment for both forms of retinoblastoma should include genetic counseling. - children with a family history of retinoblastoma should have eye exams to check for retinoblastoma. - a child who has heritable retinoblastoma has an increased risk of trilateral retinoblastoma and other cancers. - signs and symptoms of retinoblastoma include ""white pupil"" and eye pain or redness. - tests that examine the retina are used to detect (find) and diagnose retinoblastoma. - certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. retinoblastoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the retina. the retina is the nerve tissue that lines the inside of the back of the eye. the retina senses light and sends images to the brain by way of the optic nerve. although retinoblastoma may occur at any age, it occurs most often in children younger than 2 years. the cancer may be in one eye (unilateral) or in both eyes (bilateral). retinoblastoma rarely spreads from the eye to nearby tissue or other parts of the body. cavitary retinoblastoma is a rare type of retinoblastoma in which cavities (hollow spaces) form within the tumor. treatment for both forms of retinoblastoma should include genetic counseling. parents should receive genetic counseling (a discussion with a trained professional about the risk of genetic diseases) to discuss genetic testing to check for a mutation (change) in the rb1 gene. genetic counseling also includes a discussion of the risk of retinoblastoma for the child and the child's brothers or sisters."
how to diagnose retinoblastoma ?,"the following tests and procedures may be used: - physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. the doctor will ask if there is a family history of retinoblastoma. - eye exam with dilated pupil: an exam of the eye in which the pupil is dilated (opened wider) with medicated eye drops to allow the doctor to look through the lens and pupil to the retina. the inside of the eye, including the retina and the optic nerve, is examined with a light. depending on the age of the child, this exam may be done under anesthesia. there are several types of eye exams that are done with the pupil dilated: - ophthalmoscopy : an exam of the inside of the back of the eye to check the retina and optic nerve using a small magnifying lens and a light. - slit-lamp biomicroscopy : an exam of the inside of the eye to check the retina, optic nerve, and other parts of the eye using a strong beam of light and a microscope. - fluorescein angiography : a procedure to look at blood vessels and the flow of blood inside the eye. an orange fluorescent dye called fluorescein is injected into a blood vessel in the arm and goes into the bloodstream. as the dye travels through blood vessels of the eye, a special camera takes pictures of the retina and choroid to find any blood vessels that are blocked or leaking. - rb1 gene test: a laboratory test in which a sample of blood or tissue is tested for a change in the rb1 gene. - ultrasound exam of the eye: a procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off the internal tissues of the eye to make echoes. eye drops are used to numb the eye and a small probe that sends and receives sound waves is placed gently on the surface of the eye. the echoes make a picture of the inside of the eye and the distance from the cornea to the retina is measured. the picture, called a sonogram, shows on the screen of the ultrasound monitor. the picture can be printed to be looked at later. - mri (magnetic resonance imaging): a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the eye. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri). - ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the eye, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. retinoblastoma can usually be diagnosed without a biopsy. when retinoblastoma is in one eye, it sometimes forms in the other eye. exams of the unaffected eye are done until it is known if the retinoblastoma is the heritable form."

what are the symptoms of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ?,"signs of childhood all include fever and bruising. these and other signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood all or by other conditions. check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following: - fever. - easy bruising or bleeding. - petechiae (flat, pinpoint, dark-red spots under the skin caused by bleeding). - bone or joint pain. - painless lumps in the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin. - pain or feeling of fullness below the ribs. - weakness, feeling tired, or looking pale. - loss of appetite."
who is at risk for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia? ?,"key points past treatment for cancer and certain genetic conditions affect the risk of having childhood all. anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk. possible risk factors for all include the following: - being exposed to x-rays before birth. - being exposed to radiation. - past treatment with chemotherapy. - having certain genetic conditions, such as: - down syndrome. - neurofibromatosis type 1. - bloom syndrome. - fanconi anemia. - ataxia-telangiectasia. - li-fraumeni syndrome. - constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (mutations in certain genes that stop dna from repairing itself, which leads to the growth of cancers at an early age). - having certain changes in the chromosomes or genes. risk groups - in childhood all, risk groups are used to plan treatment. - relapsed childhood all is cancer that has come back after it has been treated. in childhood all, risk groups are used to plan treatment. there are three risk groups in childhood all. they are described as: - standard (low) risk: includes children aged 1 to younger than 10 years who have a white blood cell count of less than 50,000/l at the time of diagnosis. - high risk: includes children 10 years and older and/or children who have a white blood cell count of 50,000/l or more at the time of diagnosis. - very high risk: includes children younger than age 1, children with certain changes in the genes, children who have a slow response to initial treatment, and children who have signs of leukemia after the first 4 weeks of treatment. other factors that affect the risk group include the following: - whether the leukemia cells began from b lymphocytes or t lymphocytes. - whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes or genes of the lymphocytes. - how quickly and how low the leukemia cell count drops after initial treatment. - whether leukemia cells are found in the cerebrospinal fluid at the time of diagnosis. it is important to know the risk group in order to plan treatment. children with high-risk or very highrisk all usually receive more anticancer drugs and/or higher doses of anticancer drugs than children with standard-risk all. relapsed childhood all is cancer that has come back after it has been treated. the leukemia may come back in the blood and bone marrow, brain, spinal cord, testicles, or other parts of the body. refractory childhood all is cancer that does not respond to treatment."
what are the stages of childhood liver cancer ?,"key points - after childhood liver cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the liver or to other parts of the body. - there are two grouping systems for childhood liver cancer. - there are four pretext and posttext groups: - pretext and posttext group i - pretext and posttext group ii - pretext and posttext group iii - pretext and posttext group iv - there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. after childhood liver cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the liver or to other parts of the body. the process used to find out if cancer has spread within the liver, to nearby tissues or organs, or to other parts of the body is called staging. in childhood liver cancer, the pretext and posttext groups are used instead of stage to plan treatment. the results of the tests and procedures done to detect, diagnose, and find out whether the cancer has spread are used to determine the pretext and posttext groups. there are two grouping systems for childhood liver cancer. two grouping systems are used for childhood liver cancer: - the pretext group describes the tumor before the patient has treatment. - the posttext group describes the tumor after the patient has treatment. there are four pretext and posttext groups: the liver is divided into 4 sections. the pretext and posttext groups depend on which sections of the liver have cancer. pretext and posttext group i in group i, the cancer is found in one section of the liver. three sections of the liver that are next to each other do not have cancer in them. pretext and posttext group ii in group ii, cancer is found in one or two sections of the liver. two sections of the liver that are next to each other do not have cancer in them. pretext and posttext group iii in group iii, one of the following is true: - cancer is found in three sections of the liver and one section does not have cancer. - cancer is found in two sections of the liver and two sections that are not next to each other do not have cancer in them. pretext and posttext group iv in group iv, cancer is found in all four sections of the liver. there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: - tissue. the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. - lymph system. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. - blood. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. when cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. - lymph system. the cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. - blood. the cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. for example, if childhood liver cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually liver cancer cells. the disease is metastatic liver cancer, not lung cancer."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for skin cancer ?,"new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. treatment for skin cancer may cause side effects. for information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, see our side effects page. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials."

what is (are) mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome ?,"key points - mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome are diseases in which lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) become malignant (cancerous) and affect the skin. - mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome are types of cutaneous t-cell lymphoma. - a sign of mycosis fungoides is a red rash on the skin. - in the szary syndrome, cancerous t-cells are found in the blood. - tests that examine the skin and blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome. - certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome are diseases in which lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) become malignant (cancerous) and affect the skin. normally, the bone marrow makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood stem cells over time. a blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell. a myeloid stem cell becomes a red blood cell, white blood cell, or platelet. a lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast and then one of three types of lymphocytes (white blood cells): - b-cell lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection. - t-cell lymphocytes that help b-lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection. - natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses. in mycosis fungoides, t-cell lymphocytes become cancerous and affect the skin. in the szary syndrome, cancerous t-cell lymphocytes affect the skin and are in the blood. mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome are types of cutaneous t-cell lymphoma. mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome are the two most common types of cutaneous t-cell lymphoma (a type of non-hodgkin lymphoma). for information about other types of skin cancer or non-hodgkin lymphoma, see the following pdq summaries: - adult non-hodgkin lymphoma treatment - skin cancer treatment - melanoma treatment - kaposi sarcoma treatment in the szary syndrome, cancerous t-cells are found in the blood. also, skin all over the body is reddened, itchy, peeling, and painful. there may also be patches, plaques, or tumors on the skin. it is not known if the szary syndrome is an advanced form of mycosis fungoides or a separate disease."
how to diagnose ewing sarcoma ?,"tests that examine the bone and soft tissue are used to diagnose and stage ewing sarcoma. procedures that make pictures of the bones and soft tissues and nearby areas help diagnose ewing sarcoma and show how far the cancer has spread. the process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within and around the bones and soft tissues is called staging. in order to plan treatment, it is important to know if the cancer is in the area where it first formed or if it has spread to other parts of the body. tests and procedures to detect, diagnose, and stage ewing sarcoma are usually done at the same time. the following tests and procedures may be used to diagnose or stage ewing sarcoma: - physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. - mri (magnetic resonance imaging): a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the area where the tumor formed. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri). - ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the area where the tumor formed or the chest, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. - pet scan (positron emission tomography scan): a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. a pet scan and a ct scan are often done at the same time. if there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found. - bone scan : a procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. a very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. the radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner. - bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : the removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone. samples are removed from both hipbones. a pathologist views the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to see if the cancer has spread. - x-ray: an x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body, such as the chest or the area where the tumor formed. - complete blood count (cbc): a procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following: - the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. - the amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells. - the portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells. - blood chemistry studies : a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. an unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. a biopsy is done to diagnose ewing sarcoma. tissue samples are removed during a biopsy so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. it is helpful if the biopsy is done at the same center where treatment will be given. - needle biopsy : for a needle biopsy, tissue is removed using a needle. this type of needle biopsy may be done if its possible to remove tissue samples large enough to be used for testing. - incisional biopsy : for an incisional biopsy, a sample of tissue is removed through an incision in the skin. - excisional biopsy : the removal of an entire lump or area of tissue that doesnt look normal. the specialists (pathologist, radiation oncologist, and surgeon) who will treat the patient usually work together to decide where the needle should be placed or the biopsy incision should be made. this is done so that the biopsy doesn't affect later treatment such as surgery to remove the tumor or radiation therapy. if there is a chance that the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, one or more lymph nodes may be removed and checked for signs of cancer. the following tests may be done on the tissue that is removed: - cytogenetic analysis : a laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes. - immunohistochemistry : a test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. the antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. this type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer. - flow cytometry : a laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample, the percentage of live cells in a sample, and certain characteristics of cells, such as size, shape, and the presence of tumor markers on the cell surface. the cells are stained with a light-sensitive dye, placed in a fluid, and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light. the measurements are based on how the light-sensitive dye reacts to the light."
what are the stages of ewing sarcoma ?,"key points - the results of diagnostic and staging tests are used to find out if cancer cells have spread. - ewing sarcoma is described based on whether the cancer has spread from the bone or soft tissue in which the cancer began. - localized ewing sarcoma - metastatic ewing sarcoma - there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. the results of diagnostic and staging tests are used to find out if cancer cells have spread. the process used to find out if cancer has spread from where it began to other parts of the body is called staging. there is no standard staging system for ewing sarcoma. the results of the tests and procedures done to diagnose and stage ewing sarcoma are used to group the tumors into localized or metastatic. ewing sarcoma is described based on whether the cancer has spread from the bone or soft tissue in which the cancer began. ewing sarcoma is described as either localized or metastatic. localized ewing sarcoma the cancer is found in the bone or soft tissue in which it began and may have spread to nearby tissue, including nearby lymph nodes. metastatic ewing sarcoma the cancer has spread from the bone or soft tissue in which it began to other parts of the body. in ewing tumor of bone, the cancer most often spreads to the lung, other bones, and bone marrow. there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: - tissue. the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. - lymph system. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. - blood. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. when cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. - lymph system. the cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. - blood. the cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. for example, if ewing sarcoma spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually ewing sarcoma cells. the disease is metastatic ewing sarcoma, not lung cancer."
what are the treatments for testicular cancer ?,"key points - there are different types of treatment for patients with testicular cancer. - testicular tumors are divided into 3 groups, based on how well the tumors are expected to respond to treatment. - good prognosis - intermediate prognosis - poor prognosis - five types of standard treatment are used: - surgery - radiation therapy - chemotherapy - surveillance - high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant - new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - follow-up tests may be needed. there are different types of treatment for patients with testicular cancer. different types of treatments are available for patients with testicular cancer. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. testicular tumors are divided into 3 groups, based on how well the tumors are expected to respond to treatment. good prognosis for nonseminoma, all of the following must be true: - the tumor is found only in the testicle or in the retroperitoneum (area outside or behind the abdominal wall); and - the tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and - the levels of all the tumor markers are slightly above normal. for seminoma, all of the following must be true: - the tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and - the level of alpha-fetoprotein (afp) is normal. beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hcg) and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) may be at any level. intermediate prognosis for nonseminoma, all of the following must be true: - the tumor is found in one testicle only or in the retroperitoneum (area outside or behind the abdominal wall); and - the tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and - the level of any one of the tumor markers is more than slightly above normal. for seminoma, all of the following must be true: - the tumor has spread to organs other than the lungs; and - the level of afp is normal. -hcg and ldh may be at any level. poor prognosis for nonseminoma, at least one of the following must be true: - the tumor is in the center of the chest between the lungs; or - the tumor has spread to organs other than the lungs; or - the level of any one of the tumor markers is high. there is no poor prognosis grouping for seminoma testicular tumors. five types of standard treatment are used: surgery surgery to remove the testicle (inguinal orchiectomy) and some of the lymph nodes may be done at diagnosis and staging. (see the general information and stages sections of this summary.) tumors that have spread to other places in the body may be partly or entirely removed by surgery. even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy: - external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. - internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. external radiation therapy is used to treat testicular cancer. chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. see drugs approved for testicular cancer for more information. surveillance surveillance is closely following a patient's condition without giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results. it is used to find early signs that the cancer has recurred (come back). in surveillance, patients are given certain exams and tests on a regular schedule. high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. after the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. these reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the bodys blood cells. see drugs approved for testicular cancer for more information. new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials. follow-up tests may be needed. some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. men who have had testicular cancer have an increased risk of developing cancer in the other testicle. a patient is advised to regularly check the other testicle and report any unusual symptoms to a doctor right away. long-term clinical exams are very important. the patient will probably have check-ups frequently during the first year after surgery and less often after that. treatment options by stage stage 0 (testicular intraepithelial neoplasia) treatment of stage 0 may include the following: - radiation therapy. - surveillance. - surgery to remove the testicle. check the list of nci-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with testicular cancer. for more specific results, refine the search by using other search features, such as the location of the trial, the type of treatment, or the name of the drug. talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you. general information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. stage i testicular cancer treatment of stage i testicular cancer depends on whether the cancer is a seminoma or a nonseminoma. treatment of seminoma may include the following: -

what are the treatments for paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer ?,"key points - there are different types of treatment for patients with paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer. - patients with paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors with expertise in treating head and neck cancer. - three types of standard treatment are used: - surgery - radiation therapy - chemotherapy - new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - follow-up tests may be needed. there are different types of treatment for patients with paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer. different types of treatment are available for patients with paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. patients with paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors with expertise in treating head and neck cancer. treatment will be overseen by a medical oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating people with cancer. the medical oncologist works with other doctors who are experts in treating patients with head and neck cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine and rehabilitation. patients who have paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer may need special help adjusting to breathing problems or other side effects of the cancer and its treatment. if a large amount of tissue or bone around the paranasal sinuses or nasal cavity is taken out, plastic surgery may be done to repair or rebuild the area. the treatment team may include the following specialists: - radiation oncologist. - neurologist. - oral surgeon or head and neck surgeon. - plastic surgeon. - dentist. - nutritionist. - speech and language pathologist. - rehabilitation specialist. three types of standard treatment are used: surgery surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is a common treatment for all stages of paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer. a doctor may remove the cancer and some of the healthy tissue and bone around the cancer. if the cancer has spread, the doctor may remove lymph nodes and other tissues in the neck. even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. treatment given after surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy: - external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. the total dose of radiation therapy is sometimes divided into several smaller, equal doses delivered over a period of several days. this is called fractionation. - internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. external and internal radiation therapy are used to treat paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer. external radiation therapy to the thyroid or the pituitary gland may change the way the thyroid gland works. the thyroid hormone levels in the blood may be tested before and after treatment. chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. see drugs approved for head and neck cancer for more information. (paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer is a type of head and neck cancer.) new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials. follow-up tests may be needed. some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. treatment options by stage stage i paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer treatment of stage i paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer depends on where cancer is found in the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity: - if cancer is in the maxillary sinus, treatment is usually surgery with or without radiation therapy. - if cancer is in the ethmoid sinus, treatment is usually radiation therapy and/or surgery. - if cancer is in the sphenoid sinus, treatment is the same as for nasopharyngeal cancer, usually radiation therapy.

what are the symptoms of cerebellar degeneration ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of cerebellar degeneration? cerebellar degeneration is primarily characterized by a wide-legged, unsteady, lurching walk that is usually accompanied by a back and forth tremor in the trunk of the body. other signs and symptoms may include slow, unsteady and jerky movement of the arms or legs; slowed and slurred speech; and nystagmus. although cerebellar disorders usually strike adults in middle age, the age of symptomatic onset varies depending on the underlying cause of the degeneration. studies have shown that many patients with movement disorders caused by damage to the cerebellum also have psychiatric symptoms. these studies suggest that patients with cerebellar diseases may benefit from screening and treatment of psychiatric disorders."
how to diagnose cerebellar degeneration ?,"how is cerebellar degeneration diagnosed? a diagnosis of cerebellar degeneration is often suspected when concerning signs and symptoms, such as a poorly coordinated gait (walk) and uncoordinated hand/finger movements, are present. for hereditary forms of cerebellar degeneration, genetic testing may be used to confirm the diagnosis. however, this is only an option if the disease-causing gene for that particular condition is known. in cerebellar degeneration caused by acquired (non-genetic and non-inherited) conditions or conditions with an unknown genetic cause, imaging studies such as computed tomography (ct scan) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (mri scan) may be necessary to establish a diagnosis. a ct scan is an imaging method that uses x-rays to create pictures of cross-sections of the body, while an mri scan uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the brain and surrounding nerve tissues. both of these imaging methods can be used to identify brain abnormalities found in people with cerebellar degeneration. is genetic testing available for cerebellar degeneration? genetic testing is only available for cerebellar degeneration that is caused by an inherited change (mutation) in a disease-causing gene. for example, genetic testing is available for many different genes known to cause spinocerebellar ataxia (sca) which is one cause of inherited cerebellar degeneration. for more information on genetic testing for sca, please click here. for many conditions known to cause cerebellar ataxia, the genetic cause is unknown or the condition is acquired (non-genetic and non-inherited). genetic testing is not an option for people with these conditions."

what are the symptoms of mitochondrial complex ii deficiency ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of mitochondrial complex ii deficiency? the signs and symptoms of mitochondrial complex ii deficiency can vary greatly from severe life-threatening symptoms in infancy to muscle disease beginning in adulthood. many factors affect symptom and symptom severity, including what gene mutation is involved. many genes must work together to ensure that the enzyme, complex ii (succinate dehydrogenase), can perform its job normally in the body. changes in the sdha, sdhb, sdhc, sdhd, sdhaf1, or sdhaf2 genes can all potentially cause complex ii deficiency. much of what we know today about the signs and symptoms of complex ii deficiency are based on articles which describe individual patients. due to the rarity of this condition and the complexity of its cause, it is very difficult to predict how a person will be affected. we strongly recommend that you work with your or your childs healthcare provider to learn more about how the deficiency is affecting your or your childs health. in the meantime, we have summarized symptoms of complex ii deficiency which have been described in case reports: inheriting two sdha gene mutations has caused myoclonic seizures and leighs syndrome. leigh syndrome is a severe neurological disorder that typically arises in the first year of life. this condition is characterized by progressive loss of mental and movement abilities (psychomotor regression) and typically results in death within a couple of years, usually due to respiratory failure. a small number of people develop symptoms in adulthood or have symptoms that worsen more slowly. the first signs of leigh syndrome seen in infancy are usually vomiting, diarrhea, and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) that leads to eating problems. click here to visit genetics home reference and learn more about leigh syndrome. inheriting two sdhb gene mutations can cause leukodystrophy. leukodystrophies affect the myelin sheath, the material that surrounds and protects nerve cells. damage to this sheath slows down or blocks messages between the brain and the rest of the body. this leads to problems with movement, speaking, vision, hearing, and mental and physical development. most of the leukodystrophies appear during infancy or childhood. they can be hard to detect early because children seem healthy at first. however, symptoms gradually get worse over time. click here to visit medlineplus.gov and learn more about leukodystprohy. inheriting two sdhaf1 gene mutations can cause severe progressive leukoencephalopathy beginning in infancy. leukoencephalopathy refers to the degeneration of the white matter of the brain. it is usually diagnosed by mri. it causes cognitive impairment, increased muscle tone, and hyperactive reflexes. inheriting two sdhd gene mutations can cause progressive loss of mental and movement abilities (psychomotor retardation), and seizures. signs and symptoms may begin in infancy and progress through childhood. complex ii deficiency has also been described in association with dilated cardiomyopathy (and heart failure in childhood), hemolytic uremic syndrome and rhabdomyolysis, congenital dislocation of the hip joint, progressive encephalomyopathy (a disorder affecting the brain and skeletal muscle, usually causing weakness) with dementia, and kearnssayre syndrome. case reports have also demonstrated that people who have only a single mutation in one of these genes may also be at risk for health problems: having one sdha gene mutation caused optic atrophy, ataxia, proximal myopathy in adulthood. having one mutation in the sdha, sdhb, sdhc, sdhaf2, or sdhd gene can cause an increased risk for paragangliomas and/or pheochromocytomas. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for mitochondrial complex ii deficiency. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormal mitochondria in muscle tissue -

what causes wilson disease ?,"what causes wilson disease? wilson disease is caused by changes (mutations) in the atp7b gene. this gene encodes a protein that plays an important role in the transport of copper from the liver to the rest of the body. it also helps remove excess copper from the body. mutations in the atp7b gene prevent this protein from working properly, which can lead to an accumulation of copper in the body. because high levels of copper are toxic, this buildup can damage tissues and organs and cause the many signs and symptoms of wilson disease."
is wilson disease inherited ?,"is wilson disease inherited? wilson disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. this means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. the parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. when two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier."
what is (are) crystal arthropathies ?,"crystal arthropathies are a diverse group of bone diseases associated with the deposition of minerals within joints and the soft tissues around the joints. the group includes gout, basic calcium phosphate and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition diseases, and, in very rare cases, calcium oxalate crystal arthropathy which is a rare cause of arthritis characterized by deposition of calcium oxalate crystals within synovial fluid and typically occurs in patients with underlying primary or secondary hyperoxaluria. these crystals are responsible for different rheumatic syndromes, including acute or chronic synovial inflammation and cartilage degeneration. treatment depends on the specific condition."

is russell-silver syndrome inherited ?,"is russell-silver syndrome inherited? most cases of russell-silver syndrome (rss) are sporadic (not inherited), which means they occur in people with no family history of rss. less commonly, russell-silver syndrome is inherited. in some families, it appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. this means that having one ""copy"" of a genetic change in each cell is enough to cause the disorder. in some cases, an affected person inherits the genetic change from a parent. in other cases, the change occurs for the first time in an affected person. when a person with a genetic change that causes an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the genetic change. in other families, the condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. this means that to be affected, a person must have a change in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. affected people inherit one copy from each parent, who is referred to as a carrier. carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms (they are unaffected). when 2 carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a: 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected 50% (1 in 2) chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier"
what is (are) central core disease ?,"central core disease (ccd) is an inherited condition that involves muscle weakness, skeletal abnormalities, and an increased chance of having a severe reaction to some anesthesia medications. muscle weakness ranges from mild to severe and typically affects muscles in the trunk and upper legs, though muscles in the neck and face can also be affected. skeletal abnormalities may include curving of the spine (scoliosis), dislocation of the hip, or restricted motion in certain joints (contractures). some individuals with ccd have an increased chance of having a severe reaction to anesthesia, called malignant hyperthermia, which may cause muscle rigidity or break-down (rhabdomyolysis), a high fever, or a rapid heart beat. ryr1 is the only gene associated with ccd and clinical testing is available to look for disease-causing alterations in this gene known as mutations."
how to diagnose congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency ?,"how is congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (csid) diagnosed? csid can be diagnosed through clinical evaluation, detailed patient history, and tolerance lab tests. blood tests can be done to look for a flat serum glucose curve after patients are given a dose of sucrose. in addition, blood and urine samples may test positive for sucrose, maltose, or palatinose (a form of maltose) if used during tolerance testing. the feces may also show sucrose, glucose, and fructose, and an acid ph level of below 5.0 or 6.0. csid can be confirmed by taking a small sample of tissue (biopsy) from the small intestine and measuring the activity of the enzyme called sucrase-isomaltase. other tests may include a sucrose hydrogen breath test in which an abnormally high level of hydrogen will be detected in the breath of an affected individual after sucrose ingestion."
what are the treatments for congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency ?,"how might congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (csid) be treated? csid is typically treated by modifying a person's diet to reduce the amount of sucrose. because many foods contain sucrose and other complex sugars, it can be difficult to completely remove sucrase from the diet. sucraid is an oral medication containing the enzyme that does not work properly in people with this condition. by taking this medication, those with csid can eat sucrose-containing foods because this enzyme will break down sucrose. this medication must be taken with each meal or snack."
what is (are) spondylocostal dysostosis 3 ?,"spondylocostal dysostosis is a group of conditions characterized by abnormal development of the bones in the spine and ribs. in the spine, the vertebrae are misshapen and fused. many people with this condition have an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). the ribs may be fused together or missing. these bone malformations lead to short, rigid necks and short midsections. infants with spondylocostal dysostosis have small, narrow chests that cannot fully expand. this can lead to life-threatening breathing problems. males with this condition are at an increased risk for inguinal hernia, where the diaphragm is pushed down, causing the abdomen to bulge out. there are several types of spondylocostal dysostosis. these types have similar features and are distinguished by their genetic cause and how they are inherited. spondylocostal dysostosis 3 is caused by mutations in the lfng gene. it is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. treatment is symptomatic and supportive and may include respiratory support and surgery to correct inguinal hernia and scoliosis."
"what is (are) thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, congenital ?","thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (ttp), congenital is a blood disorder characterized by low platelets (i.e., thrombocytopenia), small areas of bleeding under the skin (i.e., purpura), low red blood cell count, and hemolytic anemia. ttp causes blood clots (thrombi) to form in small blood vessels throughout the body. these clots can cause serious medical problems if they block vessels and restrict blood flow to organs such as the brain, kidneys, and heart. resulting complications can include neurological problems (such as personality changes, headaches, confusion, and slurred speech), fever, abnormal kidney function, abdominal pain, and heart problems. hemolytic anemia can lead to paleness, yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate. ttp, congenital is much rarer than the acquired form and typically appears in infancy or early childhood. signs and symptoms often recur on a regular basis. ttp, congenital results from mutations in the adamts13 gene. the condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."

what are the treatments for sideroblastic anemia ?,"how might sideroblastic anemia be treated? the treatment of sideroblastic anemia is directed at controlling symptoms of anemia and preventing organ damage from iron overload. many patients see improvement with increased vitamin b6 intake - either through diet (potatoes, bananas, raisin bran cereal, lentils, liver, turkey, and tuna are good sources) or supplements - with red blood cell counts returning to near-normal values. folic acid supplementation may also be beneficial. those that do not respond to vitamin supplementation require blood transfusion. a few small studies have described the use of allogenic bone marrow or stem cell transplantation for hereditary and congenital forms of sideroblastic anemia. while these therapies may offer the possibility of a cure, the complications associated with transplantation surgery must be considered. all patients with sideroblastic anemia should be followed by a hematologist and avoid alcohol."
what is (are) rett syndrome ?,"rett syndrome is a progressive, neuro-developmental condition that primarily affects girls. affected girls appear to have normal psychomotor development during the first 6 to 18 months of life, followed by a developmental ""plateau,"" and then rapid regression in language and motor skills. additional signs and symptoms may include repetitive, stereotypic hand movements; fits of screaming and inconsolable crying; autistic features; panic-like attacks; teeth grinding (bruxism); episodic apnea and/or hyperpnea; gait ataxia and apraxia; tremors; seizures; and slowed head growth. some people have an atypical form of rett syndrome that may be more mild or more severe. classic rett syndrome is most commonly caused by mutations in the mecp2 gene and is usually inherited in an x-linked dominant manner. the vast majority of cases are not inherited from a parent, but are due to a new mutation in the affected person. treatment mainly focuses on the specific signs and symptoms of the condition."

what are the symptoms of nance-horan syndrome ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of nance-horan syndrome? the main features of nance-horan syndrome include congenital cataracts, dental abnormalities, distinctive facial features, and in some cases, intellectual disability. in affected males, the primary physical characteristic is the presence of dense clouding of the lens (cornea) of both eyes at birth (congenital bilateral cataracts). the cataracts usually result in blurred vision and severely decreased clearness or clarity of vision (visual acuity). vision loss can potentially be profound. males with nance-horan syndrome may have additional eye abnormalities, including a very small cornea (microcornea); involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and/or misalignment of the eyes (strabismus). in some cases, the entire eye may be abnormally small (microphthalmia) and/or the upper eyelid may droop (ptosis). males with nance-horan syndrome may also have several dental abnormalities such as unusually shaped, extra (supernumerary) teeth, absence of some teeth (dental agenesis), impacted teeth or unusually wide spaces (diastema) between some of the teeth. the front teeth, or incisors, are usually tapered and 'screwdriver-shaped'. the teeth in the back of the mouth may be cone-shaped, rounded, or cylindrical. in many males with nance-horan syndrome, other physical findings may also occur. distinctive facial features may be present, but may be subtle. the ears may be flared forward and unusually prominent. affected males may also have a large, prominent nose with a high, narrow nasal bridge, a narrow prominent jaw, and sometimes a long, narrow face. some males with nance-horan syndrome may also experience delays the skills necessary for coordinating muscular and mental activity. in addition, some reports suggest that approximately 20 to 30 percent of affected males may have varying levels of intellectual disability, which is usually mild to moderate; but in some cases can be severe. females who carry a single copy of the mutation in the nhs gene may develop some symptoms of the disorder. however, symptoms are usually milder and more variable than those seen in males. affected females may have abnormally small corneas (microcornea) and/or some clouding of the cornea. vision may be normal, or there may be slightly decreased visual acuity. without appropriate treatment, clouding of the cornea can lead to total cataracts later in life. females often have some dental abnormalities, such as abnormally-shaped front teeth and/or unusually wide spaces between some of the teeth. affected females usually do not develop intellectual disability. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for nance-horan syndrome. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormal nasal morphology 90% cataract 90% long face 90% mandibular prognathia 90% microcornea 90% nystagmus 90% prominent nasal bridge 90% visual impairment 90% intellectual disability, moderate 80% abnormality of the metacarpal bones 50% cognitive impairment 50% increased number of teeth 50% strabismus 50% aplasia/hypoplasia affecting the eye 7.5% behavioral abnormality 7.5% glaucoma 7.5% retinal detachment 7.5% autism - broad finger - congenital cataract - diastema - macrotia - microphthalmia - narrow face - posterior y-sutural cataract - prominent nose - screwdriver-shaped incisors - short phalanx of finger - supernumerary maxillary incisor - visual loss - x-linked dominant inheritance - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what are the symptoms of hypoplastic left heart syndrome ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of hypoplastic left heart syndrome? normally, oxygen-poor blood is pumped through the right side of the heart to the lungs, where it gains oxygen and returns to the left side of the heart. the oxygen-rich blood is then pumped from the left side of the heart to the rest of the body. at birth, all babies also have two connections, or shunts, between the two sides of the heart; however, within a few days of birth these connections close. in those with hlhs, the underdeveloped left side of the heart is unable to provide enough blood flow to the body. the normal shunts present at birth help to direct blood to the body; when these connections close the oxygen-rich blood supply decreases. at first, a newborn with hlhs may appear normal. symptoms usually occur in the first few hours of life, although it may take up to a few days to develop symptoms. these symptoms may include: bluish (cyanosis) or poor skin color cold hands and feet (extremities) lethargy poor pulse poor suckling and feeding pounding heart rapid breathing shortness of breath in healthy newborns, bluish color in the hands and feet is a response to cold (this reaction is called peripheral cyanosis). however, a bluish color in the chest or abdomen, lips, and tongue is abnormal (called central cyanosis). it is a sign that there is not enough oxygen in the blood. central cyanosis often increases with crying. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) hypoplastic left heart 90% abnormality of the aorta 50% abnormality of chromosome segregation 7.5% abnormality of the mitral valve 7.5% atria septal defect 7.5% maternal diabetes 7.5% patent ductus arteriosus 7.5% the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."

what is (are) citrullinemia type i ?,"citrullinemia type i is an inherited disorder that causes ammonia and other toxic substances to accumulate in the blood. this condition, also known as classic citrullinemia, belongs to a class of genetic diseases called urea cycle disorders. in most cases, the condition becomes evident in the first few days of life. affected infants typically appear normal at birth, but as ammonia builds up in the body they experience a progressive lack of energy (lethargy), poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, and loss of consciousness. citrullinemia type i is caused by mutations in the ass1 gene. it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
what causes citrullinemia type i ?,"what causes citrullinemia type i? citrullinemia type i is caused by mutations in the ass1 gene. this gene provides instructions for making an enzyme, argininosuccinate synthetase 1, that is responsible for the third step in the urea cycle. mutations in the ass1 gene reduce the activity of the enzyme, which disrupts the urea cycle and prevents the body from processing nitrogen effectively. excess nitrogen (in the form of ammonia) and other byproducts of the urea cycle accumulate in the bloodstream. ammonia is particularly toxic to the nervous system, which helps explain the neurologic symptoms (such as lethargy, seizures, and ataxia) that are often seen in this condition."
is citrullinemia type i inherited ?,"how is citrullinemia type i inherited? citrullinemia type i is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."

what causes williams syndrome ?,"what causes williams syndrome? williams syndrome is caused by the deletion of genetic material from a specific region of chromosome 7. the deleted region includes more than 25 genes, and researchers believe that a loss of several of these genes probably contributes to the characteristic features of this disorder. clip2, eln, gtf2i, gtf2ird1, and limk1 are among the genes that are typically deleted in people with williams syndrome. researchers have found that the loss of the eln gene is associated with the connective tissue abnormalities and cardiovascular disease (specifically supravalvular aortic stenosis) found in many people with this condition. studies suggest that deletions of clip2, gtf2i, gtf2ird1, limk1, and perhaps other genes may help explain the characteristic difficulties with visual-spatial tasks, unique behavioral characteristics, and other cognitive difficulties seen in people with williams syndrome. loss of the gtf2ird1 gene may also contribute to the distinctive facial features often associated with this condition. researchers believe that the presence or absence of the ncf1 gene on chromosome 7 is related to the risk of developing hypertension in people with williams syndrome. when the ncf1 gene is included in the part of the chromosome that is deleted, affected individuals are less likely to develop hypertension. therefore, the loss of this gene appears to be a protective factor. people with williams syndrome whose ncf1 gene is not deleted have a higher risk of developing hypertension. the relationship between other genes in the deleted region of chromosome 7 and the signs and symptoms of williams syndrome is unknown."

is juvenile retinoschisis inherited ?,"how is juvenile retinoschisis inherited? juvenile retinoschisis is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. the gene associated with this condition is located on the x chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation must be present in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. males are affected by x-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. a striking characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons. in x-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one mutated copy of the gene (mutation) in each cell is called a carrier. she can pass on the mutation, but usually does not experience signs and symptoms of the condition. carrier women have a 50% chance of passing the mutation to their children, males who inherit the mutation will be affected; females who inherit the mutation will be carriers and will nearly always have normal vision. carrier testing for at-risk female relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family is known."

what are the symptoms of mecp2 duplication syndrome ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of mecp2 duplication syndrome? mecp2 duplication syndrome is a condition that occurs almost exclusively in males and is characterized by moderate to severe intellectual disability. infants affected by this condition are generally diagnosed with severe hypotonia within the first few weeks of life. this reduced muscle tone can lead to feeding difficulties which may require a feeding tube. trouble swallowing, gastroesophageal reflux, failure to thrive, and extensive drooling are also common symptoms. distinctive physical features may be noticed shortly after birth which can include brachycephaly (abnormally flat back of the head), midface hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the middle of the face), large ears, deep-set eyes, prominent chin, and a depressed nasal bridge. due to hypotonia, affected children often have delayed development of motor milestones such as sitting up and crawling. approximately, one third of affected people never walk independently and those who are able to walk may have an abnormal gait (style of walking). in most cases, hypotonia gives way to spasticity during childhood. progressive spasticity, which is generally more pronounced in the legs, may lead to the development of mild contractures. consequently, many affected adults require the use of a wheelchair. the majority of affected people do not develop the ability to talk. some may have limited speech during early childhood, but frequently this ability is progressively lost during adolescence. other signs and symptoms associated with mecp2 duplication syndrome may include seizures; autistic features; clinically significant constipation and bladder dysfunction. many people affected by mecp2 duplication syndrome have recurrent respiratory tract infections. these respiratory infections can be life-threatening and as a result, approximately half of affected people succumb by age 25. in most cases, females with a duplication of the mecp2 gene do not have any symptoms, although depression, anxiety, and autistic features have been described in some. when affected, women with mecp2 duplication syndrome are generally less severely affected than males with the condition. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for mecp2 duplication syndrome. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis - abnormality of the teeth - absent speech - anxiety - ataxia - brachycephaly - bruxism - chorea - constipation - cryptorchidism - depressed nasal bridge - depression - drooling - dysphagia - facial hypotonia - flat midface - gastroesophageal reflux - infantile muscular hypotonia - intellectual disability - low-set ears - macrocephaly - macrotia - malar flattening - microcephaly - narrow mouth - poor eye contact - progressive - progressive spasticity - recurrent respiratory infections - rigidity - seizures - severe global developmental delay - tented upper lip vermilion - x-linked recessive inheritance - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what causes mecp2 duplication syndrome ?,"what causes mecp2 duplication syndrome? mecp2 duplication syndrome occurs when there is an extra copy (duplication) of the mecp2 gene in each cell. this is generally caused by a duplication of genetic material located on the long (q) arm of the x chromosome. the size of the duplication can vary; however, this does not appear to affect the severity of the condition. people with larger duplications have signs and symptoms that are similar to people with smaller duplications. the mecp2 gene encodes a protein that is important for normal brain functioning. although it plays many roles, one of its most important functions is to regulate other genes in the brain by switching them on and off. a duplication of the mecp2 gene leads to the production of excess protein, which is unable to properly regulate the expression of other genes. this results in irregular brain activity, leading to the signs and symptoms of mecp2 duplication syndrome."
what are the treatments for mecp2 duplication syndrome ?,"how might mecp2 duplication syndrome be treated? because mecp2 duplication syndrome affects many different systems of the body, medical management is often provided by a team of doctors and other healthcare professionals. treatment for this condition varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. for example, infants with trouble swallowing and/or other feeding difficulties may require a feeding tube. early developmental interventions may be recommended to help affected children reach their potential. this may include physical therapy, speech therapy and/or occupational therapy. medications may be prescribed to treat seizures or spasticity. recurrent infections are usually treated aggressively with appropriate antibiotics. please speak with a healthcare provider if you have any questions about your personal medical management plan or that of a family member."

what causes mosaic trisomy 9 ?,"what causes mosaic trisomy 9? most cases of mosaic trisomy 9 occur due to a random event during the formation of the reproductive cells (egg and sperm) or after fertilization has taken place. an error in cell division (called nondisjunction) may cause some eggs or sperm to have an abnormal number of chromosomes. if an egg or sperm with an extra chromosome 9 contributes to the genetic makeup of an embryo, the embryo will have an extra copy of chromosome 9 in each cell. as the embryo grows and divides, an attempt may be made to correct the mistake by eliminating one extra chromosome 9. in people with mosaic trisomy 9, this attempt may be partly successful, leaving some cells with an extra chromosome 9 and some cells with the extra chromosome deleted (the usual chromosome number). this correction process is called trisomy rescue. in other cases, the egg and sperm may have a normal number of chromosomes, but an error of cell division (nondisjunction) occurs when the fertilized egg is growing and dividing. if an error occurs during one of the divisions, it can cause some cells to have an abnormal number of chromosomes. in people affected by mosaic trisomy 9, some of the body's cells have the usual two copies of chromosome 9, and other cells have three copies of this chromosome (trisomy). the percentage of cells with trisomy 9 and which parts of the body are affected vary from person to person. this leads to variability in the range and severity of symptoms. in rare cases, mosaic trisomy 9 is inherited from a parent with a chromosomal rearrangement called a ""pericentric inversion."" this occurs when a segment of chromosome 9 has broken off in two places, swiveled round 180 degrees and reinserted itself into the chromosome. if this rearrangement is considered ""balanced,"" meaning the piece of chromosome is in a different order but no genetic material is gained or lost, it usually does not cause any symptoms or health problems. however, it can be associated with an increased risk of having children with an abnormal number or chromosomes."

what causes angelman syndrome ?,"what causes angelman syndrome? angelman syndrome is caused by a loss of function of a gene called ube3a on chromosome 15. the exact mechanism that causes this loss of function is complex. people normally inherit one copy of the ube3a gene from each parent. both copies of this gene are turned on (active) in many of the body's tissues. in certain areas of the brain, however, only the copy inherited from a person's mother is active. this parent-specific gene activation is known as genomic imprinting. if the maternal copy of the ube3a gene is lost because of a chromosomal change or a gene mutation, a person will have no active copies of the gene in some parts of the brain. several different genetic mechanisms can inactivate or delete the maternal copy of the ube3a gene. most cases of angelman syndrome occur when a segment of the maternal chromosome 15 containing this gene is deleted. in other cases, angelman syndrome is caused by a mutation in the maternal copy of the ube3a gene. in a small percentage of cases, a person with angelman syndrome inherits two copies of chromosome 15 from his or her father, instead of one copy from each parent. this is called paternal uniparental disomy. rarely, angelman syndrome can also be caused by a chromosomal rearrangement called a translocation, or by a mutation or other defect in the region of dna that controls activation of the ube3a gene. these genetic changes can abnormally turn off (inactivate) ube3a or other genes on the maternal copy of chromosome 15. the cause of angelman syndrome is unknown in 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals. changes involving other genes or chromosomes may be responsible for the condition in these individuals."
what causes microscopic polyangiitis ?,"what causes microscopic polyangiitis (mpa)? the cause of mpa is unknown. it is not contagious, does not usually run in families, and is not a form of cancer. the immune system is thought to play a critical role in the development of mpa. it is thought that the immune system becomes overactive and causes blood vessel and tissue inflammation, which leads to organ damage. it is not known what causes the immune system to become overactive."
what are the treatments for microscopic polyangiitis ?,"what is the treatment for microscopic polyangiitis (mpa)? mpa is treated with medications that suppress the immune system, which can lower an individual's resistance to infections. there are a variety of immune suppressing medications that are used in mpa; however, resources state that a steroid (usually prednisone) and a medication toxic to cells (usually starting with cyclophosphamide) are typically prescribed first. the goal of treatment is to stop all of the organ damage that occurs as a result of mpa. the duration of treatment with immune suppressing medication varies between individuals, but is typically given for at least one to two years."

is holt-oram syndrome inherited ?,"how is holt-oram syndrome inherited? holt-oram syndrome (hos) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. this means that having only one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause signs and symptoms of the condition. in most cases, the mutation in the gene occurs for the first time in the affected person and is not inherited from a parent. when a mutation occurs for the first time, it is called a de novo mutation. this is what typically occurs when there is no family history of the condition. a de novo mutation is due to a random change in the dna in an egg or sperm cell, or right after conception. in some cases, an affected person inherits the mutated copy of the gene from an affected parent. in these cases, the symptoms and severity can differ from those of the affected parent. when a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherit the condition."
how to diagnose holt-oram syndrome ?,"how is holt-oram syndrome diagnosed? the diagnosis of holt-oram syndrome can be established based on physical features and family history. it can be confirmed through genetic testing looking for mutations in the tbx5 gene. hand x-rays are usually performed for upper-limb malformations. a family history of this condition and/or cogenital heart malformations is also used as a diagnostic tool as a congenital heart malformation is present in 75% of individuals with holt-oram syndrome. an echocardiogram and electrocardiogram can be used to determine the presence and severity of heart defects and/or cardiac conduction disease. holt-oram syndrome can be excluded in individuals with congenital malformations involving the following structures or organ systems: ulnar ray only, kidney, vertebra, head and face region, auditory system (hearing loss or ear malformations), lower limb, anus, or eye."
how to diagnose progressive bulbar palsy ?,"how is progressive bulbar palsy diagnosed? what tests aid in the diagnosis of progressive bulbar palsy? progressive bulbar palsy is a difficult to diagnose condition. no one test or procedure offers a definitive diagnosis. diagnosis is largely based upon the person's symptoms, tests that show how well their nerves are working (e.g., an emg or electromyography), and ruling out other causes for the symptoms. particularly, stroke and a condition called myasthenia gravis, may have certain symptoms that are similar to those of progressive bulbar palsy and must be ruled out prior to diagnosing this disorder. testing for acetylcholine receptor-binding antibodies may be helpful in ruling out myasthenia gravis. because of the lack of definitive tests, you may find it helpful to consult with a doctor who is experienced in diagnosing als. the als association lists experts and specialty centers through their web site at: http://www.alsa.org/community/als-clinics"

what are the treatments for doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy ?,"how might doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy (dhrd) be treated? there is currently no cure for doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy (dhrd) and treatment options are limited. management of hereditary retinal dystrophies generally focuses on vision rehabilitation, which involves the use of low vision aids, orientation, and mobility training. the goal of visual rehabilitation is to reach maximum function, a sense of well being, a personally satisfying level of independence, and optimum quality of life. choroidal neovascularization (cnv), the growth of new blood vessels in the choroid, can develop in people with dhrd and has a poor visual prognosis. the authors of a 2011 study reported that 2 people with dhrd and cnv were treated with a course of intravitreal bevacizumab (injected into the eye). this treatment stopped fluid leakage and led to increased visual acuity. they proposed that recovery of visual acuity after treatment of cnv in these cases shows that the loss of retinal function may be reversible. however, this finding needs to be confirmed in more studies with a larger number of participants. there was also a case report of a person with malattia leventinese (a condition very similar to dhrd and sometimes considered the same) who was treated successfully with photodynamic therapy using verteporfin. the treatment reportedly prevented severe visual loss in the patient. the authors of this case report proposed that photodynamic therapy be considered as a possible treatment in patients with malattia leventinese or dhrd who develop cnv. you may consider participating in a clinical trial for treatment of retinal dystrophy. the u.s. national institutes of health, through the national library of medicine, developed clinicaltrials.gov to provide patients, family members, and members of the public with current information on clinical research studies. there are many clinical trials currently enrolling individuals with hereditary retinal dystrophy. view a list of these studies here. after you click on a study, review its eligibility criteria to determine its appropriateness. we suggest reviewing the list of studies with your physician. use the studys contact information to learn more. you can check this site often for regular updates. use ""retinal dystrophy"" or ""doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy"" as your search term."

how to diagnose down syndrome ?,"how is down syndrome diagnosed? down syndrome may be suspected and/or diagnosed during pregnancy, or after a child is born. during pregnancy, a woman can opt to have specific tests that may either screen for, or diagnosis, down syndrome in a fetus. a screening test poses no risks to the fetus and can determine the likelihood that a fetus has down syndrome. it may show that a fetus is at an increased risk to be affected, but cannot determine whether it is definitely affected. screening tests for down syndrome may involve different types of blood tests for the mother and/or specific types of ultrasounds that can detect features more common in fetuses with down syndrome (called markers). depending on the type of screening tests a woman has, they may be done during the 1st trimester, the 2nd trimester, or both. if a screening test shows an increased risk for down syndrome, a woman may then choose to have a diagnostic test. diagnostic tests during pregnancy can determine with certainty whether a fetus has down syndrome, but they are invasive and carry a slight risk of miscarriage. examples of diagnostic tests include chorionic villus sampling in the 1st trimester and amniocentesis in the 2nd trimester. during these tests, a small sample of genetic material is obtained from the amniotic fluid or placenta, and the fetus' chromosomes are then analyzed in a laboratory. in recent years, non-invasive prenatal testing (nipt) has become available to women who are at increased risk to have a baby with down syndrome. nipt is a blood test that examines dna from the fetus in the mother's bloodstream. however, women who have a positive nipt result should then have invasive diagnostic testing to confirm the result. people with questions about the different options for prenatal screening or diagnostic testing should speak with a genetic counselor. a genetic counselor can discuss the benefits, limitations and risks of each test, and help each person decide which test (if any) is best for them. if a diagnosis of down syndrome is not made prenatally, the diagnosis can be made in the newborn. down syndrome may be suspected if a newborn has characteristic physical features of the condition. the diagnosis can then be confirmed by obtaining a karyotype (a blood test to look at a picture of the newborn's chromosomes)."

how to diagnose congenital adrenal hyperplasia ?,"is genetic testing avaliable for congenital adrenal hyperplasia? yes, genetic testing is available for many of the genes known to cause congenital adrenal hyperplasia (cah). carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing are possible if the disease-causing mutations in the family are known. the genetic testing registry (gtr) is a centralized online resource for information about genetic tests. the intended audience for the gtr is health care providers and researchers. patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. how is congenital adrenal hyperplasia diagnosed? shortly after birth, all newborns in the united states are screened for a variety of conditions, including 21-hydroxylase deficiency. this is the most common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (cah) and accounts for 95% of classic cah cases. nonclassic cah is not detected through newborn screening and is often not suspected until signs and symptoms of the condition begin to appear later in childhood or early adulthood. in these cases, a diagnosis of cah is usually based on physical examination; blood and urine tests that measure hormone levels; and/or genetic testing. an x-ray may also be helpful in confirming the diagnosis in children since cah can cause bones to grow and develop more quickly than usual (advanced bone age) ."
what are the treatments for congenital adrenal hyperplasia ?,"how might congenital adrenal hyperplasia be treated? the best treatment options for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (cah) depend on many factors including the type of cah and the signs and symptoms present in each person. many people with cah require steroids to replace the low hormones. these medications will need to be taken daily throughout life or the symptoms of cah may return. it is important that affected people on medications be closely followed by their healthcare provider because their dose may need to be adjusted at different times in life such as periods of high stress or illness. girls with severe cah who are born with ambiguous genitalia may undergo surgery to ensure proper function and/or to make the genitals look more female. for more information on the treatment of cah, please click here."
what is (are) myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease ?,"myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases are a group of diseases of the blood and bone marrow in which the bone marrow makes too many white blood cells. these disease have features of both myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative disorders. in myelodysplastic diseases, the blood stem cells do not mature into healthy red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets and as a result, there are fewer of these healthy cells. in myeloproliferative diseases, a greater than normal number of blood stem cells develop into one or more types of blood cells and the total number of blood cells slowly increases. the 3 main types of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases include chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (cmml); juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (jmml); and atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia (acml). when a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease does not match any of these types, it is called myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable (mds/mpn-uc). symptoms of cmml and jmml may include fever, feeling tired and weight loss. symptoms of acml may include easy bruising or bleeding and feeling tired or weak. myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases may progress to acute leukemia. there are different types of treatment for individuals with one of these diseases, which may include chemotherapy, another drug therapy, stem cell transplant and/or supportive care."

what causes behcet's disease ?,"what causes behcet's disease? the exact cause of behet's disease is unknown. most symptoms of the disease are caused by inflammation of the blood vessels. inflammation is a characteristic reaction of the body to injury or disease and is marked by four signs: swelling, redness, heat, and pain. doctors think that an autoimmune reaction may cause the blood vessels to become inflamed, but they do not know what triggers this reaction. under normal conditions, the immune system protects the body from diseases and infections by killing harmful ""foreign"" substances, such as germs, that enter the body. in an autoimmune reaction, the immune system mistakenly attacks and harms the body's own tissues. behet's disease is not contagious; it is not spread from one person to another. researchers think that two factors are important for a person to get behet's disease. first, it is believed that abnormalities of the immune system make some people susceptible to the disease. scientists think that this susceptibility may be inherited; that is, it may be due to one or more specific genes. second, something in the environment, possibly a bacterium or virus, might trigger or activate the disease in susceptible people."
what is (are) multiple familial trichoepithelioma ?,"multiple familial trichoepithelioma is a rare condition characterized by multiple smooth, round, firm, skin-colored tumors (trichoepitheliomas) that usually occur on the face, but may also occur on the scalp, neck, and trunk. the tumors are derived from immature hair follicles. they usually first develop during childhood or adolescence and may grow larger and increase in number over time. the condition can be caused by alterations (mutations) in the cyld gene or by mutations in other genes which are still unknown. the condition may be divided in two subtypes, multiple familial trichoepithelioma type 1 and multiple familial trichoepithelioma type 2. susceptibility to multiple familial trichoepithelioma is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell increases the risk of developing this condition. however, a second, non-inherited mutation is required for development of skin appendage tumors in this disorder.treatment often involves surgery to remove a single lesion and cryosurgery or laser surgery for multiple ones."
is microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type 1 inherited ?,"how is microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type 1 (mopd1) inherited? mopd1 is thought to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. this means that affected individuals have abnormal gene changes (mutations) in both copies of the disease-causing gene, with one copy inherited from each parent. the parents who each carry one abnormal copy of the gene are referred to as carriers; carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of an autosomal recessive condition. when two carriers have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier."

how to diagnose klinefelter syndrome ?,how is klinefelter syndrome diagnosed? a diagnosis of klinefelter syndrome is often suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. additional testing can then be ordered to confirm the diagnosis. this generally includes a chromosomal analysis (called a karyotype). it is also possible to diagnosis klinefelter syndrome before birth through chorionic villous sampling or amniocentesis.
what are the treatments for klinefelter syndrome ?,"how might klinefelter syndrome be treated? because symptoms of klinefelter syndrome (ks) can sometimes be very mild, many people are never diagnosed or treated. when a diagnosis is made, treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. this may include: educational interventions - as children, many people with klinefelter syndrome qualify for special services to help them in school. teachers can also help by using certain methods in the classroom, such as breaking bigger tasks into small steps. therapeutic options - a variety of therapists, such as physical, speech, occupational, behavioral, mental health, and family therapists can often help reduce or eliminate some of the symptoms of klinefelter syndrome such as poor muscle tone; speech and language problems; or low self-confidence. medical management - about half of people with ks have low testosterone levels, which may be raised by taking supplemental testosterone. having a more normal testosterone level can help affected people develop bigger muscles, a deeper voice, and facial and body hair. many healthcare providers recommend testosterone therapy when a boy reaches puberty. however, not all males with ks benefit from testosterone therapy. some affected people may opt to have breast removal or reduction surgery. the eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development's web site offers more specific information on the treatment and management of klinefelter syndrome. please click on the link to access this resource."
what causes majeed syndrome ?,"what causes majeed syndrome? majeed syndrome is caused by mutations in the lpin2 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called lipin-2. researchers believe that this protein may play a role in the processing of fats. it may also be involved in controlling inflammation and play a role in cell division. mutations in the lpin2 gene alter the structure and function of lipin-2. it is unclear how these genetic changes lead to bone disease, anemia, and inflammation of the skin in people with majeed syndrome."
what are the treatments for majeed syndrome ?,"how might majeed syndrome be treated? treatment is based upon the symptoms present. chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (crmo) is treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) and physical therapy to avoid disuse atrophy of muscles and contractures. if crmo does not respond to nsaids, corticosteroids can be used short term to control crmo and skin manifestations. resolution of bone inflammation has been reported in at least two children who were treated with an il-1 inhibitor. congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (cda) may be treated with red blood cell transfusion."
what are the treatments for keratoconus ?,"what causes keratoconus? the exact cause of keratoconus is unknown. both genetic and environmental factors may play a role in the development of keratoconus. the genetic factors involve abnormalities in the structure of collagen, which result in a weak and flexible cornea. keratoconus is more common in people with down syndrome, marfan syndrome, and leber congenital amaurosis, and certain genetic conditions. in these cases, the cause depends on the specific condition. environmental factors may include living in sunny, hot areas of the world, while eye-rubbing is a major behavioral factor in the disease. malfunctioning enzymes that normally help maintain the health of the cornea may play a role. all of these factors contribute to the main problem in keratoconus, which is the defective collagen structure that results in thinning and irregularity of the cornea. keratoconus occurs more frequently in patients with atopy (asthma and eczema) or severe ocular allergies. it may also be linked to hormonal factors because it is more frequent during puberty and also may progress during pregnancy."

what is (are) ehlers-danlos syndrome ?,"ehlers-danlos syndrome (eds) is a group of inherited connective tissue disorders that is caused by abnormalities in the structure, production, and/or processing of collagen. there are 6 major forms of eds: hypermobility type, classic type, vascular type, kyphoscoliosis type, arthrochalasia type, and dermatosparaxis type. although other forms of the condition exist, they are extremely rare and are not well-characterized. the signs and symptoms of eds vary by type and range from mildly loose joints to life-threatening complications. features shared by many types include joint hypermobility and soft, velvety skin that is highly elastic (stretchy) and bruises easily. changes (mutations) in a variety of genes may lead to eds; however, the underlying genetic cause in some families is unknown. depending on the subtype, eds may be inherited in an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive manner. there is no specific cure for eds. the treatment and management is focused on preventing serious complications and relieving associated signs and symptoms."
what are the symptoms of ehlers-danlos syndrome ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of ehlers-danlos syndrome? there are six major types of ehlers-danlos syndrome (eds). although there is significant overlap in associated features, the subtypes are classified based on their unique signs and symptoms: hypermobility type - characterized primarily by joint hypermobility affecting both large (elbows, knees) and small (fingers, toes) joints which may lead to recurrent joint dislocations and subluxations (partial dislocation). affected people generally experience skin involvement (soft, smooth and velvety skin with easy bruising) and chronic pain of the muscles and/or bones, as well. classic type - associated with extremely elastic (stretchy), smooth skin that is fragile and bruises easily; wide, atrophic scars (flat or depressed scars); and joint hypermobility. molluscoid pseudotumors (calcified hematomas over pressure points such as the elbow) and spheroids (fat-containing cysts on forearms and shins) are frequently diagnosed in affected people. hypotonia and delayed motor development may occur, as well. vascular type - characterized by thin, translucent skin that is extremely fragile and bruises easily. arteries and certain organs such as the intestines and uterus are also fragile and prone to rupture. affected people typically have short stature; thin scalp hair; and characteristic facial features including large eyes, a thin nose and lobeless ears. joint hypermobility is present, but generally confined to the small joints (fingers, toes). other common features include club foot; tendon and/or muscle rupture; acrogeria (premature aging of the skin of the hands and feet); early onset varicose veins; pneumothorax (collapse of a lung); gingival (gums) recession; and a decreased amount of subcutaneous (under the skin) fat. kyphoscoliosis type - associated with severe hypotonia at birth, delayed motor development, progressive scoliosis (present from birth), and scleral fragility. affected people may also have easy bruising; fragile arteries that are prone to rupture; unusually small cornia; and osteopenia (low bone density). other common features include a ""marfanoid habitus"" which is characterized by long, slender fingers (arachnodactyly); unusually long limbs; and a sunken chest (pectus excavatum) or protruding chest (pectus carinatum). arthrochalasia type - characterized by severe joint hypermobility and congenital hip dislocation. other common features include fragile, elastic skin with easy bruising; hypotonia; kyphoscoliosis (kyphosis and scoliosis); and mild osteopenia. dermatosparaxis type - associated with extremely fragile skin leading to severe bruising and scarring; saggy, redundant skin, especially on the face; and hernias. for more information on each subtype, please click on the links above. you can also find more detailed information on medscape reference's web site or the ehlers-danlos national foundation's web site. although other forms of the condition exist, they are extremely rare and are not well-characterized."
how to diagnose ehlers-danlos syndrome ?,"how is ehlers-danlos syndrome diagnosed? a diagnosis of ehlers-danlos syndrome is typically based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. depending on the subtype suspected, some of the following tests may be ordered to support the diagnosis: collagen typing performed on a skin biopsy may aid in the diagnosis of vascular type, arthrochalasia type, and dermatosparaxis type. collagen is a tough, fiber-like protein that makes up about a third of body protein. it is part of the structure of tendons, bones, and connective tissues. people with ehlers-danlos syndrome often have abnormalities of certain types of collagen. genetic testing is available for many subtypes of ehlers-danlos syndrome; however, it is not an option for most families with the hypermobility type. imaging studies such as ct scan, mri, ultrasound, and angiography may be useful in identifying certain features of the condition. urine tests to detect deficiencies in certain enzymes that are important for collagen formation may be helpful in diagnosing kyphoscoliosis type."
is adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy inherited ?,"how is adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy inherited? the majority of cases with an identified family history or genetic cause are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. this means that in order to be affected, a person only needs a change (mutation) in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell. in some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. other cases may result from a new (de novo) mutation in the gene. these cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. when caused by a known mutation inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, a person with adult-onset macular dystrophy (avmd) has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child. the inheritance pattern of avmd can be confusing as not all individuals with avmd have a family history and not all individuals who inherit a causative gene mutation develop symptoms."

what is (are) cramp-fasciculation syndrome ?,"cramp-fasciculation syndrome (cfs) is a rare condition of the muscles. affected people have persistent muscle twitching (fasciculations) and cramping, which can lead to muscle discomfort, pain, or tiredness. muscles in the leg are most commonly affected, although this condition may involve several parts of the body. symptoms are thought to be due to overactivity of the associated nerves. in most cases, cfs occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. there is limited information about the treatment of cfs, but certain medications have been reported as beneficial in individual cases."
what are the symptoms of cramp-fasciculation syndrome ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of cramp-fasciculation syndrome? cramp-fasciculation syndrome (cfs) is primarily associated with severe muscle cramps and muscle twitches occurring in otherwise healthy people. these symptoms are often triggered by physical activity and may be relieved by stretching exercises and/or masssage. muscles in the thighs and calves are most commonly affected, although other muscles (i.e. arm, chest) can also be involved. the severity of the condition varies significantly. in severe cases, cfs can interfere with daily activities (i.e. work, household chores) and quality of life."
what is (are) nephropathic cystinosis ?,"cystinosis is an inherited condition in which the body accumulates the amino acid cystine (a building block of proteins) within the cells. excess cystine forms crystals that can build up and damage cells. these crystals can negatively affect many systems in the body, especially the kidneys and eyes. there are three distinct types of cystinosis: nephropathic cystinosis, intermediate cystinosis, and non-nephropathic or ocular cystinosis. all three types of cystinosis are caused by mutations in the ctns gene and inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.[1]"
is metachromatic leukodystrophy inherited ?,"how is metachromatic leukodystrophy inherited? metachromatic leukodystrophy is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. this means that both copies of the disease-causing gene in each cell must have a mutation for an individual to be affected. individuals inherit two copies of each gene - one copy from each parent. typically, an individual is affected because they inherited a mutated copy of the gene from each parent. individuals with one mutated copy of the gene (such as an unaffected parent of an affected individual) are referred to as carriers; carriers typically do not have any signs or symptoms of the condition. when two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier."

what is (are) myelodysplastic syndromes ?,"myelodysplastic syndromes (mds) are a rare group of blood disorders characterized by abnormal development of blood cells within the bone marrow. individuals with mds have abnormally low blood cell levels (low blood counts). signs and symptoms associated with mds include dizziness, fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, bruising and bleeding, frequent infections, and headaches. in some cases, mds may progress to bone marrow failure or an acute leukemia. the exact cause of mds is unknown. it sometimes runs in families, but no disease-causing gene has been identified. treatment depends on the affected individual's age, general health, and type of mds and may include red cell and/or platelet transfusions and antibiotics."
what causes myelodysplastic syndromes ?,"what causes myelodysplastic syndromes? it is known that the abnormal development of blood cells associated with myelodysplastic syndromes (mds) develops as the result of a series of somatic genetic changes - mutations that are not inherited that arise after conception - in cells that later become blood cells. these changes alter normal cell growth and differentiation, resulting in the accumulation of abnormal, immature cells in the bone marrow, thus leading to the signs and symptoms of mds. some recurring chromosome abnormalities and translocations have been identified and can affect treatment planning and prognosis. many times the underlying cause of mds is unknown (idiopathic mds). sometimes, mds can develop after chemotherapy and radiation treatment for cancer or autoimmune diseases (secondary mds). there are also some possible risk factors for developing the condition. having a risk factor does not mean that an individual will get mds; not having risk factors doesnt mean that an individual will not get mds. possible risk factors for mds may include past treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy; exposure to some chemicals (pesticides and benzene); exposure to heavy metals (such as mercury or lead); cigarette smoking; viral infections; being over 60 years of age; and being male or white. the majority of individuals developing mds have no obvious connection with environmental hazards. mds also sometimes runs in families, which suggests a potential genetic link with the disease; however, no disease causing gene has been identified."
what is (are) pustular psoriasis ?,"pustular psoriasis is a rare form of psoriasis that is characterized by widespread pustules and reddish skin. this condition can occur alone or with plaque-type psoriasis. most cases of pustular psoriasis are thought to be ""multifactorial"" or associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors. there are several triggers for this conditions including withdrawal from corticosteroids, exposure to various medications and/or infections. some cases of the generalized form are caused by changes (mutations) in the il36rn gene and are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. in severe cases, hospitalization may be required. treatment aims to alleviate the associated symptoms and may include certain medications and/or phototherapy."

what are the treatments for parkes weber syndrome ?,"how might parkes weber syndrome be treated? for capillary malformations (such as port wine stains) that are of cosmetic concern, individuals may be referred to a dermatologist. for arteriovenous malformations (avms) and arteriovenous fistulas (avfs), the risks and benefits of intervention (i,e, embolization versus surgery) may be considered, usually with input from a multi-disciplinary team (e.g., specialists in interventional radiology, neurosurgery, surgery, cardiology, and dermatology). for risks associated with heart failure, referral to a cardiologist may be warranted. hypertrophy (overgrowth) of the limb and/or difference in size between limbs may be treated surgically by an orthopedist. supportive care may include compression garments (tight-fitting pieces of clothing on the affected limb to reduce pain and swelling); these may also protect the limb from bumps and scrapes, which can cause bleeding. heel inserts may be used if the legs are different lengths, which can aid in walking normally. various pain medications and antibiotic medications may be prescribed as needed."
is osteogenesis imperfecta inherited ?,"how is osteogenesis imperfecta inherited? osteogenesis imperfecta (oi) is most commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. this means that having only one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of oi. the mutated copy of the gene may be inherited from an affected parent, or it may occur for the first time in an affected person (a de novo mutation). when a person with an autosomal dominant form of oi has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of inheriting the mutated gene. if the child inherits the mutated gene, the child's symptoms may be milder, or more severe, than those of the parent. less commonly, oi is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. this means that both copies of the responsible gene in each cell must have a mutation for a person to be affected. the parents of a person with an autosomal recessive condition typically are unaffected, but each carry one mutated copy of the gene. when two carriers of an autosomal recessive form of oi have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be a carrier like each parent, and a 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier."
what is (are) 15q13.3 microduplication syndrome ?,"15q13.3 microduplication syndrome is a rare chromosome abnormality first described in 2009. since only a small number of individuals with this microduplication have been reported, the full range of effects is still being discovered. what is known is that the symptoms are variable, even between members of the same family. while some people with this microduplication do not have symptoms, several features seem to be common, including delayed development, intellectual disability, communication difficulties, emotional and behavioral problems (including autistic spectrum disorders), insomnia, and seizures. 15q13.3 microduplication syndrome is caused by a tiny duplication (microduplication) on the long arm of chromosome 15 that spans at least 6 genes. the features of this syndrome are thought to be caused by the presence of three copies of the genes in this region, instead of the normal two. however, it is unclear which genes contribute to the specific features. in addition, it is likely that other genetic or environmental factors influence the symptoms seen in this condition. some cases of 15q13.3 microduplication syndrome are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance. other cases are new (de novo). treatment typically focuses on treating the symptoms (such as medication for seizures)."

what causes schindler disease type 1 ?,"what causes schindler disease type 1? schindler disease type 1 is caused by mutations in the naga gene. this gene provides instructions for making the enzyme alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase.this enzyme works in the lysosomes (compartments within cells that digest and recycle materials) to help break down complexes called glycoproteins and glycolipids (sugar molecules attached to certain proteins and fats). more specifically, alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase helps remove a molecule called alpha-n-acetylgalactosamine from sugars in these complexes. mutations in the naga gene interfere with the ability of the alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase enzyme to perform its role in breaking down glycoproteins and glycoliipids. these substances accumulate in the lysosomes and cause cells to malfunction and eventually die. cell damage in the nervous system and other tissues and organs of the body leads to the signs and symptoms of schindler disease type 1."

what is (are) narcolepsy ?,"narcolepsy is a chronic brain disorder that involves poor control of sleep-wake cycles. people with narcolepsy have episodes of extreme daytime sleepiness and sudden, irresistible bouts of sleep (called ""sleep attacks"") that can occur at any time, and may last from seconds or minutes. other signs and symptoms may include cataplexy (a sudden loss of muscle tone that makes a person go limp or unable to move); vivid dream-like images or hallucinations; and/or total paralysis just before falling asleep or after waking-up. narcolepsy may have several causes, the most common being low levels of the neurotransmitter hypocretin (for various possible reasons). the disorder is usually sporadic but some cases are familial. there is no cure, but some symptoms can be managed with medicines and lifestyle changes."
what are the treatments for congenital chloride diarrhea ?,"how might congenital chloride diarrhea be treated? there is no cure for the underlying condition, so treatment mainly focuses on the symptoms. studies have shown that early diagnosis and aggressive salt replacement therapy (replacing sodium and chloride, the 2 things that make up salt) are associated with normal growth and development, in addition to reduced mortality rates. in individuals with this condition, the goal is for the oral intake of chloride, sodium, and potassium to be greater than the amount lost through the feces (i.e., there must be a positive gastrointestinal balance) so that losses in sweat can be replaced. replacement therapy with nacl (sodium chloride) and kcl (potassium chloride) has been shown to be effective in children. one study showed that a medication called omeprazole, a proton-pump inhibitor, reduces electrolyte losses in individuals and thus promotes a positive gastrointestinal balance. however, this treatment does not reduce the need for careful monitoring of dietary intake, electrolyte concentrations, and urinary chloride loss. another study discussed how butyrate could be effective in treating the condition, and that it is easily administered, useful in preventing severe dehydration episodes, and may be a promising approach for a long-term treatment."
what is (are) galloway-mowat syndrome ?,"galloway-mowat syndrome is a rare, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by various developmental and physical abnormalities. signs and symptoms may include small head size (microcephaly); developmental delay; seizures; nephrotic syndrome; hiatal hernia; optic atrophy; movement disorders; and intellectual disability. other physical abnormalities may also be present. galloway-mowat syndrome may be caused by changes (mutations) in the wdr73 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. other, unknown genes may also be responsible. affected children often do not survive beyond the first few years of life. treatment is aimed at the specific signs and symptoms present."
what causes medium-chain acyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase deficiency ?,"what causes medium-chain acyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase (mcad) deficiency? mutations in the acadm gene cause medium-chain acyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase deficiency. mutations in the acadm gene lead to inadequate levels of an enzyme called medium-chain acyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase. without sufficient amounts of this enzyme, medium-chain fatty acids from food and fats stored in the body are not metabolized properly. as a result, these fats are not converted to energy, which can lead to characteristic signs and symptoms of this disorder such as lethargy and low blood sugar. medium-chain fatty acids or partially metabolized fatty acids may accumulate in tissues and can damage the liver and brain, causing serious complications."
how to diagnose medium-chain acyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase deficiency ?,"how is medium-chain acyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase deficiency (mcadd) diagnosed? mcadd is now included in many newborn screening programs. if a newborn screening result for mcadd is not in the normal range, additional testing is recommended. a diagnosis of mcadd can be made through a blood test called a plasma acylcarnitine profile and an evaluation of organic acids in the urine. the diagnosis can also be confirmed by genetic testing."
what are the treatments for reticulohistiocytoma ?,"how might reticulohistiocytoma be treated? reticulohistiocytoma (rh) typically resolve spontaneously over a period of months to years; however, surgical excision usually results in a cure."

what is (are) hereditary multiple osteochondromas ?,"hereditary multiple osteochondromas (hmo) (formerly called hereditary multiple exostoses) is a genetic condition in which people develop multiple benign (noncancerous) bone tumors that are covered by cartilage (called osteochondromas). the number and location of osteochondromas varies greatly among affected individuals. these tumors are not present at birth, but almost all affected people develop multiple osteochondromas by the time they are 12 years old. once the bones stop growing, the development of new osteochondromas also usually stops. osteochondromas can cause abnormal growth of the arms, hands, and legs, which can lead to uneven limb lengths (limb length discrepancy) and short stature. these tumors may cause pain, limit joint movement, and exert pressure on nerves, blood vessels, and surrounding tissues. osteochondromas are typically benign; however, researchers estimate that people with hmo have about a 1% lifetime risk of these tumors becoming a cancerous osteochondrosarcoma. hmo is caused by mutations in the ext1 and ext2 genes and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern."
what are the treatments for hereditary multiple osteochondromas ?,"how might hereditary multiple osteochondromas (hmo) be treated? currently, there is no known medical treatment for hmo. osteochondromas are not usually removed because they stop growing around age 12. another consideration is how close the tumor is to the affected bone's growth plate, because surgery can affect how the bone grows. surgery may be considered, however, if an osteochondroma is causing pain, bone fracture, nerve irritation, or if the tumor continues to grow after the person's bones have stopped growing. the surgical treatment of choice is complete removal of the tumor. depending on the location of the osteochondroma, this may be relatively simple. however, if an osteochondroma is close to nerves and blood vessels, this may make surgery difficult and risky. surgery may also be necessary to correct painful limb abnormalities that are caused by multiple osteochondromas. surgery may be needed to cut and realign the bones that have become deformed, which is known as osteotomy. if the legs are not equal in length, treatment may include a procedure to slow down the growth of the longer leg. surgery may also be needed to correct the forearm deformity seen in this condition. adults with this condition who have untreated forearm deformities usually do not have significant functional limitations. although rare, an osteochondroma can become cancerous (malignant), which usually takes the form of a low grade chondrosarcoma. this type of malignant tumor is unlikely to spread elsewhere in the body. higher grades of cancer can occur, but this is even more uncommon. in that case, other therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiation, may be used in treatment. genereviews provides more information about treatment for hereditary multiple osteochondromas. how might a malignant transformation in hereditary multiple exostoses (hme) be treated? chondrosarcomas in a person with hme tend to be well differentiated and low grade tumors. the tumors usually grow slowly and do not readily metastasize. surgical removal is the recommended treatment as the condrosarcomas do not respond to radiation or chemotherapy. the prognosis or long term outlook after surgical removal of the chondrosarcoma for a person with hme is good as long as the tumor has not metastasized."
what are the symptoms of von hippel-lindau disease ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of von hippel-lindau disease? symptoms of von hippel-lindau (vhl) disease vary among patients and depend on the size and location of the tumors. hemangioblastomas that develop in the brain and spinal cord can cause headaches, vomiting, weakness, and a loss of muscle coordination (ataxia). hemangioblastomas can also occur in the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye (the retina). these tumors, which are also called retinal angiomas, may cause vision loss. pheochromocytomas affect the adrenal glands, which are small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. these tumors often cause no symptoms, but in some cases they can produce an excess of hormones that cause dangerously high blood pressure. about 10 percent of people with vhl disease develop endolymphatic sac tumors, which are noncancerous tumors in the inner ear. these growths can cause hearing loss in one or both ears, as well as ringing in the ears (tinnitus) and problems with balance. individuals with vhl disease are also at a higher risk than normal for certain types of cancer, especially kidney cancer. renal cell carcinoma occurs in about 70% of individuals with vhl disease by age 60 and is the leading cause of mortality. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for von hippel-lindau disease. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormality of the cerebral vasculature 90% abnormality of the retinal vasculature 90% aplasia/hypoplasia of the cerebellum 90% arteriovenous malformation 90% neurological speech impairment 90% nystagmus 90% pancreatic cysts 90% renal neoplasm 90% sensorineural hearing impairment 90% visceral angiomatosis 90% gait disturbance 50% hemiplegia/hemiparesis 50% hydrocephalus 50% incoordination 50% migraine 50% multicystic kidney dysplasia 50% nausea and vomiting 50% telangiectasia of the skin 50% visual impairment 50% abnormality of the lymphatic system 7.5% abnormality of the macula 7.5% arrhythmia 7.5% cataract 7.5% glaucoma 7.5% hyperhidrosis 7.5% hypertensive crisis 7.5% increased intracranial pressure 7.5% neoplasm of the middle ear 7.5% neuroendocrine neoplasm 7.5% polycystic kidney dysplasia 7.5% retinal detachment 7.5% abnormality of the liver - autosomal dominant inheritance - cerebellar hemangioblastoma - epididymal cyst - hypertension - multiple renal cysts - neoplasm of the pancreas - papillary cystadenoma of the epididymis - paraganglioma - phenotypic variability - pheochromocytoma - polycythemia - pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis - renal cell carcinoma - retinal capillary hemangioma - spinal hemangioblastoma - tinnitus - vertigo - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."

what is (are) fetal retinoid syndrome ?,"fetal retinoid syndrome is a characteristic pattern of physical and mental birth defects that results from maternal use of retinoids during pregnancy. the most well known retinoid is isotretinoin (accutane), a drug used to treat severe cystic acne. birth defects associated with fetal retinoid syndrome include: hydrocephalus, microcephaly, intellectual disabilities, ear and eye abnormalities, cleft palate and other facial differences, and heart defects. isotretinoin can cause these birth defects in the early weeks of pregnancy, even before a woman knows that she is pregnant."
"what causes hydrops, ectopic calcification, moth-eaten skeletal dysplasia ?","what causes hem? hem is associated with mutations (changes) in the lamin b receptor (lbr) gene located on chromosome 1, specifically at 1q42.1. each person has two copies of the lbr gene - one inherited from mom and the other from dad. people who have two mutated copies of the lbr gene have hem; thus, the condition is said to be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. the presence of two mutated copies of the lbr gene may affect the structure of the nucleus of the cell as well."
what is (are) femoral facial syndrome ?,"femoral-facial syndrome is characterized by underdevelopment of the thigh bones and certain facial features, which may include upslanting eyes, short nose with a broad tip, long space between the nose and upper lip (philtrum), thin upper lip, small or underdeveloped lower jaw (micrognathia), and cleft palate. symptoms may affect one or both sides of the face and limbs. cleft palate has been reported only in females. other signs and symptoms occur variably. intellectual development has been reported as normal. in most cases the cause of the condition is unknown (sporadic). some cases have been reported in association with diabetes during pregnancy (maternal diabetes). there have been rare reports (three cases) describing a family with more than one affected member."
what is (are) disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis ?,"disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis (dpl) is a rare condition which is characterized by nodules or small lumps of smooth muscle cells located on the peritoneum (lining of the abdominal wall) and abdominal organs.the condition is usually benign (noncancerous) but in rare cases has become cancerous. although it can be seen in post-menopausal women and very rarely in men, dpl occurs most often in women of childbearing age. most women with dpl are pregnant, taking the birth control pill, or have uterine leioyomas or estrogen-secreting tumors. some people with dpl have no signs or symptoms of the condition. when present, symptoms may include abdominal and pelvic pain; rectal or vaginal bleeding; and less commonly constipation. the cause of dpl is unknown but may be linked to hormonal and genetic factors. some cases of dpl resolve when hormone levels are returned to normal. however, surgery may be suggested based on the size and location of the tumor."
is noonan syndrome inherited ?,"how is noonan syndrome inherited? noonan syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. this means that having one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause the condition. each child of a person with noonan syndrome has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the condition. in some cases, the condition is inherited from an affected parent. because the features of the condition can vary and may be very subtle, many affected adults are diagnosed only after the birth of a more obviously affected infant. in other cases, the condition is caused by a new mutation occurring for the first time in the affected person."
how to diagnose hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome ?,"how is hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis (huv) diagnosed? what kind of tests are required? a diagnosis of hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis (huv) syndrome is supported by findings from varied tests, such as skin biopsy, blood tests, physical and eye examinations, and urinalysis and kidney imaging studies (when glomerulonephritis is suspected). people with huv syndrome have hives (urticaria) for at least six months and low levels of proteins (complement) in the blood. complement levels can be determined through a blood test. click here to visit the american association for clinical chemistry's web site lab tests online to learn more about this test. in addition to these major criteria, people with huv syndrome must also have at least two of the following minor criteria: inflammation in the small veins of the dermis (diagnosed by biopsy) joint pain or arthritis mild glomerulonephritis inflammation in the eye (uvea or episclera) recurrent abdominal pain the presence of anti-c1q antibodies (this test is not widely available) some people have urticarial vasculitis and low complement levels (hypocomplementemia), but do not meet diagnostic criteria for huv syndrome. these individuals may be diagnosed as having huv (where symptoms are limited to the skin), versus huv syndrome. differential diagnoses for huv syndrome include, schnitzler's syndrome, cogan's syndrome, and muckle-wells syndrome."

"what causes craniometaphyseal dysplasia, autosomal dominant ?","what causes autosomal dominant craniometaphyseal dysplasia? autosomal dominant craniometaphyseal dysplasia is caused by mutations in the ankh gene. the ankh gene provides instructions for making a protein that is present in bone and transports a molecule called pyrophosphate out of cells. pyrophosphate helps regulate bone formation by preventing mineralization, the process by which minerals such as calcium and phosphorus are deposited in developing bones. the ankh protein may have other, unknown functions. mutations in the ankh gene that cause autosomal dominant craniometaphyseal dysplasia may decrease the ankh protein's ability to transport pyrophosphate out of cells. reduced levels of pyrophosphate can increase bone mineralization, contributing to the bone overgrowth seen in craniometaphyseal dysplasia. why long bones are shaped differently and only the skull bones become thicker in people with this condition remains unclear."

what causes opitz g/bbb syndrome ?,"what causes opitz g/bbb syndrome? the x-linked form of opitz g/bbb syndrome is caused by mutations in the mid1 gene. the mid1 gene provides instructions for making a specific protein called midline-1. this protein helps regulate the function of microtubules, which are rigid, hollow fibers that make up the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton). microtubules help cells maintain their shape, assist in the process of cell division, and are essential for the movement of cells (cell migration). the mid1 gene is a member of a group of genes called the trim (tripartite motif) family. the proteins produced from this large family of genes are involved in many cellular activities. primarily, trim proteins play a role in the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unwanted proteins. as part of its protein degrading function, midline-1 is responsible for recycling certain proteins, including phosphatase 2a (pp2a), integrin alpha-4 (itga4), and serine/threonine-protein kinase 36 (stk36). the recycling of these three proteins so they can be reused instead of broken down is essential because they are needed for normal cellular functioning. mutations in the mid1 gene lead to a decrease in midline-1 function, which prevents this protein recycling. as a result, certain proteins are not recycled, and they accumulate in cells. this buildup impairs microtubule function, resulting in problems with cell division and migration. researchers speculate that the altered midline-1 protein affects how the cells divide and migrate along the midline of the body during development, resulting in the features of opitz g/bbb syndrome. some people who have a family history of x-linked opitz g/bbb syndrome have no detectable mid1 mutation. the reason for this is not yet known, although some researchers have suggested the involvement of other unknown genes. the autosomal dominant form of opitz g/bbb syndrome is caused by a deletion of a small piece of chromosome 22, specifically 22q11.2, which is why researchers consider this condition to be part of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. it is not yet known which deleted gene(s) within this region of chromosome 22 specifically cause the signs and symptoms of opitz g/bbb syndrome. in others with autosomal dominant opitz g/bbb syndrome, the cause is related to a mutation in the speccil gene. click on the gene name to learn more about its role in the development of this condition."

what causes proud syndrome ?,"what causes proud syndrome? proud syndrome is caused by changes (mutations) in the arx gene, which encodes a protein that regulates the activity of other genes. this protein is especially important during early embryonic development since it is thought to be involved in the formation of many different body structures such as the pancreas, testes, brain, and muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). for example, the protein helps regulate the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation) within the pancreas, testes, and muscles. in the developing brain, it plays many different roles such as assisting with the movement of neurons to their final locations. specific changes in the arx gene impair the function of the protein, which may disrupt the normal development of many different parts of the body. this can lead to the many signs and symptoms associated with proud syndrome."

what is (are) split hand foot malformation ?,"split hand foot malformation (shfm) is a type of birth defect that consists of missing digits (fingers and/or toes), a deep cleft down the center of the hand or foot, and fusion of remaining digits. the severity of this condition varies widely among affected individuals. shfm is sometimes called ectrodactyly; however, this is a nonspecific term used to describe missing digits. shfm may occur by itself (isolated) or it may be part of a syndrome with abnormalities in other parts of the body. at least six different forms of isolated shfm have been described. each type is associated with a different underlying genetic cause. shfm1 has been linked to chromosome 7, and shfm2 is linked to the x chromosome. shfm3 is caused by a duplication of chromosome 10 at position 10q24. changes (mutations) in the tp63 gene cause shfm4. shfm5 is linked to chromosome 2, and shfm6 is caused by mutations in the wnt10b gene. shfm may be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or x-linked manner."
what causes split hand foot malformation ?,"what causes split hand foot malformation? split hand foot malformation may occur as an isolated feature or it may be associated with a genetic syndrome. researchers believe that a large number of mutations can cause split hand foot malformation. a few of which have been identified: fbxw4 and tp63. most commonly the conditions are passed through families in an autosomal dominant fashion with reduced penetrance. in autosomal dominant inheritance an affected parent would have a 1 in 2 or 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing the genetic defect to his/her offspring. in conditions with reduced penetrance a person who inherits the underlying genetic defect, may never develop the condition. more rarely other forms of inheritance have been reported (e.g., autosomal-recessive, x-linked, chromosome deletions, chromosome duplications)."
what causes triple a syndrome ?,"what causes triple a syndrome? mutations in the aaas gene cause triple a syndrome in many affected individuals. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called aladin, whose function is not well understood. within cells, aladin is found in the nuclear envelope, the structure that surrounds the nucleus and separates it from the rest of the cell. based on its location, aladin is thought to be involved in the movement of molecules into and out of the nucleus of the cell. mutations in the aaas gene prevent this protein from reaching its proper location in the cell, which may disrupt the movement of molecules. researchers suspect that dna repair proteins may be unable to enter the nucleus if aladin is missing from the nuclear envelope. dna damage that is not repaired can cause the cell to become unstable and lead to cell death. although the nervous system is particularly vulnerable to dna damage, it remains unknown exactly how mutations in the aaas gene lead to the signs and symptoms of triple a syndrome. some individuals with triple a syndrome do not have an identified mutation in the aaas gene; in these individuals, the genetic cause of the disorder is unknown."
what causes ovarian carcinosarcoma ?,"is there a hereditary cause for ovarian carcinosarcoma? ovarian carcinosarcoma is not thought to be caused by an inherited gene mutation. however, one article in the medical literature suggests that an inherited mutation in the brca2 gene contributed to the development of ovarian carcinosarcoma in one woman."
is spastic diplegia cerebral palsy inherited ?,"is spastic diplegia cerebral palsy inherited? scientists have found that family members of people with cerebral palsy, including spastic diplegia cerebral palsy, have an increased risk of developing the condition. the exact risk depends on the how closely the family members are related: a child with a sibling (brother, sister) or parent with cerebral palsy would have a six- to nine-fold increased risk of developing the condition (actual risk: 1 to 1.5%) a child with a half sibling with cerebral palsy would have up to a three-fold risk of developing the condition (actual risk: less than 1%) a child with a first cousin with cerebral palsy would have a 1.5-fold increased risk of developing the condition (actual risk: less than 1%) this suggests that there may be a genetic component in some cases of cerebral palsy. however, the inheritance is likely multifactorial which means the condition is caused by multiple genes interacting with each other and with environmental factors."

what causes hemochromatosis ?,"what causes hemochromatosis? the underlying cause of hemochromatosis depends on whether a person has a hereditary form, an acquired form, or the neonatal form. hereditary hemochromatosis is caused by mutations in any of several genes: type 1 hemochromatosis - the hfe gene type 2 hemochromatosis - either the hfe2 or hamp gene type 3 hemochromatosis - the tfr2 gene type 4 hemochromatosis - the slc40a1 gene these genes give the body instructions to make proteins that help regulate how iron is absorbed, transported, and stored. mutations in these genes impair how iron is absorbed during digestion and alter the distribution of iron throughout the body. this causes iron to accumulate in tissues and organs. acquired hemochromatosis (or secondary hemochromatosis) is usually due to other blood-related disorders, such as thalassemia or certain anemias, or having many blood transfusions. sometimes it occurs as a result of long-term alcoholism or other health conditions. the cause of neonatal hemochromatosis is not fully understood. however, a woman with an affected child has approximately an 80% chance to have another affected child. this likelihood of recurrence is not explained by normal inheritance patterns. therefore, this form appears to be familial, but not inherited."

how to diagnose glioblastoma ?,"is genetic testing available for glioblastoma? genetic testing is not available for many people with glioblastoma since most of these tumors occur sporadically (by chance) and are not caused by a genetic mutation. however, genetic testing is an option for people with an inherited condition that predisposes to glioblastoma such as neurofibromatosis type 1, turcot syndrome and li fraumeni syndrome. carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing are possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family is known. the genetic testing registry (gtr) is a centralized online resource for information about genetic tests. it provides a list of laboratories performing genetic testing for neurofibromatosis type 1, turcot syndrome and li fraumeni syndrome. the intended audience for the gtr is health care providers and researchers. patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. how is glioblastoma diagnosed? glioblastoma is typically diagnosed based on a physical exam that identifies characteristic symptoms and various imaging studies such as computed tomography (ct) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (mri). a ct scan is an imaging method that uses x-rays to create pictures of cross-sections of the body, while an mri scan uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the brain and surrounding nerve tissues. these imaging studies will also provide information regarding the size of the tumor and which parts of the brain are affected. surgical removal of the tumor or a small biopsy may confirm the diagnosis."
what causes aquagenic pruritus ?,"what causes aquagenic pruritus? the exact cause of aquagenic pruritus is unknown, but increased mast cell degranulation (release of granules rich in histamine and other compounds into the body by mast cells, a special type of cell that plays a role in the immune system), increased circulating histamine, release of acetylcholine (a chemical in the body which sends signals from nerves to muscles and between nerves in the brain), and increased skin fibrinolytic activity (activity that controls clot size by promoting the breakdown of clots) have all been named as possible causes of the condition. in some cases, it appears to be a symptom of polycythemia vera."
what causes fine-lubinsky syndrome ?,"what causes fine-lubinsky syndrome? the cause of fine-lubinsky syndrome remains unknown. with the exception of one family report of an affected brother and sister (suggesting an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern), all other cases have been sporadic (occurring in people with no family history of fls). additional reports are needed to identify a possible genetic cause of fls. while karyotypes (pictures of chromosomes) were reportedly normal in affected people, the presence of a very small chromosomal rearrangement (too small to detect with a karyotype) as a possible cause for fls has not been ruled out."
is fine-lubinsky syndrome inherited ?,"how is fine-lubinsky syndrome inherited? almost all people reported to have finelubinsky syndrome (fls) have been the only affected people in their families (these cases were sporadic). there has been one report of an affected brother and sister with unaffected parents, suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance. additional reports are needed to identify a possible genetic cause for the condition. parents of a child with fls should be aware that if the condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to be affected. although karyotypes (pictures of chromosomes) have been reported as normal in affected people, the presence of a very small chromosomal rearrangement has not been excluded as a possible cause of fls."
what causes lynch syndrome ?,"what causes lynch syndrome? lynch syndrome is caused by mutations in at least 5 genes (mlh1, msh2, msh6, pms2 or epcam). all of these genes are involved in the repair of mistakes made when dna is copied (dna replication) in preparation for cell division. mutations in any of these genes prevent the proper repair of dna replication mistakes. as the abnormal cells continue to divide, the accumulated mistakes can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and possibly cancer. although mutations in these genes predispose individuals to cancer, not all people who carry these mutations develop cancerous tumors."
is lynch syndrome inherited ?,"is lynch syndrome an inherited condition? lynch syndrome cancer risk is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one inherited copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase cancer risk. it is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop cancer."
how to diagnose lynch syndrome ?,"how is lynch syndrome diagnosed? the diagnosis of lynch syndrome can be made on the basis of the amsterdam clinical criteria or on the basis of molecular genetic testing for germline mutations in one of several mismatch repair (mmr) genes. to read detailed diagnostic strategies, click here."
what is (are) multicentric reticulohistiocytosis ?,"multicentric reticulohistiocytosis is a disease that is characterized by the presence of papules and nodules and associated with arthritis mutilans. the disease can involve the skin, the bones, the tendons, the muscles, the joints, and nearly any other organ (e.g., eyes, larynx, thyroid, salivary glands, bone marrow, heart, lung, kidney, liver, gastrointestinal tract). in the majority of cases, the cause of multicentric reticulohistiocytosis is unknown; however, it has been associated with an underlying cancer in about one fourth of cases, suggesting that it may be a paraneoplastic syndrome."
what are the symptoms of multicentric reticulohistiocytosis ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of multicentric reticulohistiocytosis? the main symptoms of multicentric reticulohistiocytosis are arthritis and red to purple skin nodules varying in size from 1 to 10 mm. the nodules can be found on any part of the body but tend to concentrate on the face and hands and decrease in number from head to toe. the arthritis is most often symmetrical and polyarticular (affecting many joints). unlike adult rheumatoid arthritis, it does not spare the joints closest to the fingertips. it can be severely destructive, and in one third of cases it progresses to arthritis multilans. further history reveals that approximately one third of patients complain of symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and malaise; less often, pericarditis and myositis are present. the clinical presentation of multicentric reticulohistiocytosis is insidious in onset and begins with arthritic complaints in approximately two thirds of patients. it is potentially one of the most rapidly destructive forms of arthritis. joint involvement remits and relapses, gradually worsening into a debilitating and permanent arthritis multilans. the severity of the damage has been reported to be related to the age of onset; therefore, the earlier one has symptoms, the more severe the symptoms tend to be. like the associated arthritis, skin lesions tend to wax and wane until the disease spontaneously resolves, but may leave permanent disfigurement. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for multicentric reticulohistiocytosis. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormality of the oral cavity 90% abnormality of the skin 90% arthritis 90% abnormality of temperature regulation 7.5% decreased body weight 7.5% muscle weakness 7.5% the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."

what are the treatments for squamous cell carcinoma ?,"how might squamous cell carcinoma be treated? skin cancer generally has a high cure rate if it is treated early. treatment depends on how big the tumor is, its location, and how far it has spread (metastasis). methods of treatment for squamous cell carcinoma may include: curettage and desiccation - scraping away the cancer and using electricity to kill any remaining cancer cells; this is used to treat cancers that are not very large or deep surgical excision - cutting out of the tumor and stitching up the remaining tissue radiation therapy (if the skin cancer is located in an area difficult to treat surgically) microscopically controlled excision (mohs surgery) - repeated cutting out of small pieces of tissue that are then examined microscopically to check if any cancer has been left behind; repeated application of this technique minimizes the removal of healthy tissue and is cosmetically more satisfying, especially if carried out with a plastic surgeon as part of the medical team. this is more likely to be used for skin cancers on the nose, ears, and other areas of the face. cryosurgery - freezing and killing the cancer cells skin creams and medications - may be used to treat superficial (not very deep) squamous cell carcinoma. the outlook for small squamous cell lesions that are removed early and completely is extremely favorable, with about 95% cured if they are removed promptly."
what is (are) achalasia ?,"achalasia is a disorder of the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. it is characterized by enlargement of the esophagus, impaired ability of the esophagus to push food down toward the stomach (peristalsis), and failure of the ring-shaped muscle at the bottom of the esophagus (the lower esophageal sphincter) to relax. achalasia is typically diagnosed in individuals between 25 and 60 years of age. the exact etiology is unknown, however, symptoms are caused by damage to the nerves of the esophagus. familial studies have shown evidence of a potential genetic influence. when a genetic influence is suspected, achalasia is called familial esophageal achalasia. treatment is aimed at reducing the pressure at the lower esophageal sphincter and may include botox, medications, or surgery."
how to diagnose achalasia ?,"how is achalasia diagnosed? achalasia is suspected in individuals with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and in instances where regurgitation symptoms are not responsive to protein pump inhibitor medication. the diagnosis of achalasia is confirmed by manometry (test that measures how well the esophagus is working); however, other tests such as upper endoscopy and upper gi x-ray can additionally be useful."

what are the symptoms of vlcad deficiency ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of vlcad deficiency? there are three forms of vlcad deficiency: a severe, early-onset form; a hepatic (liver) or hypoketotic hypoglycemic form; and a later-onset episodic myopathic form. signs and symptoms of the severe, early-onset form occur in the first few months of life and include cardiomyopathy (heart disease), pericardial effusion (fluid around the heart), heart arrhythmias (abnormal heart beat), low muscle tone, enlarged liver, and intermittent hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). the heart problems can be life threatening, but are often improved with early treatment and diet modifications. people affected by the hepatic or hypoketotic hypoglycemic form typically develop symptoms during early childhood. these features may include hypoketotic hypoglycemia and enlarged liver (without cardiomyopathy). ""hypoketotic"" refers to a low level of ketones, which are produced during the breakdown of fats and used for energy. hypoglycemia refers to low blood sugar. together, these signs are called ""hypoketotic hypoglycemia."" the episodes of hypoglycemia seen in the early-onset form and hepatic/hypoketotic hypoglycemia form can cause a child to feel weak, shaky and/or dizzy with clammy, cold skin. if not treated, it can lead to coma, and possibly death. periods of hypoglycemia can also occur with other symptoms as part of a metabolic crisis. signs and symptoms of the later-onset episodic myopathic form may include intermittent rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of muscle), muscle cramps, muscle pain, and exercise intolerance. it is the most common form of vlcad deficiency."
is vlcad deficiency inherited ?,"is vlcad deficiency inherited? vlcad deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. this means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. the parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. when two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier."

what is (are) cone dystrophy ?,"cone dystrophy is a general term for a group of rare eye disorders that affect the cone cells of the retina. cone cells allow a person to see color and fine detail, and they work best in bright light. the cone dystrophies can cause a variety of symptoms such as decreased visual clarity when looking straight ahead, a reduced ability to see colors, and an increased sensitivity to light. there are two main subtypes of cone dystrophy, called stationary cone dystrophy and progressive cone dystrophy. the age when symptoms begin, the type and severity of symptoms, and the progression of symptoms are all very different between individuals, even between people with the same type of cone dystrophy. mutations in many genes have been found to cause cone dystrophy, and the condition can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or x-linked manner."
how to diagnose cone dystrophy ?,"how is cone dystrophy diagnosed? the diagnosis of cone dystrophy is made based upon the presence of characteristic symptoms, a detailed family history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a number of supporting tests. while exams that measure visual acuity, perception of color, and field of vision are used to arrive at a proper diagnosis, an electroretinogram (erg) is used to confirm the diagnosis. during an erg, eye drops are used to numb the eye before a special contact lens recorder is placed on the eye. then a series of flashes of light are used to stimulate the retina. doctors can then measure the electrical response of the rods and cones to the light. the test is performed twice once in bright room and again in a dark room. a weak of absent signal of cone cells indicates cone dystrophy. more details about the diagnosis of cone dystrophy can be accessed through the university of michigan kellogg eye center."

is platelet storage pool deficiency inherited ?,"is platelet storage pool deficiency inherited? platelet storage pool deficiency refers to a group of conditions that can be acquired (non-inherited) or inherited. hereditary forms of the condition may be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or x-linked manner. in autosomal dominant conditions, one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause signs or symptoms of the condition. when a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherit the mutated copy of the gene from the affected parent. when a condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, a person must have a change in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. the parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. when two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier. a condition is considered x-linked if the mutated gene that causes the condition is located on the x chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes (the y chromosome is the other sex chromosome). women have two x chromosomes and men have an x and a y chromosome. x-linked conditions can be x-linked dominant or x-linked recessive. the inheritance is x-linked dominant if one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. women with an x-linked dominant condition have a 50% chance of passing the condition on to a son or a daughter with each pregnancy. men with an x-linked dominant condition will pass the condition on to all of their daughters and none of their sons. the inheritance is x-linked recessive if a gene on the x chromosome causes the condition in men with one gene mutation (they have only one x chromosome) and in females with two gene mutations (they have two x chromosomes). a woman with an x-linked condition will pass the mutation on to all of her sons and daughters. this means that all of her sons will have the condition and all of her daughters will be carriers. a man with an x-linked recessive condition will pass the mutation to all of his daughters (carriers) and none of his sons."

how to diagnose stiff person syndrome ?,"is genetic testing available for stiff person syndrome? genetic testing is not available for stiff person syndrome, as the underlying genetic cause (if any) has not yet been established. how is stiff person syndrome diagnosed? a diagnosis of stiff person syndrome (sps) is typically made based on the presence of the characteristic symptoms, a detailed medical history, a thorough clinical exam, and various tests. specific tests are used to support or confirm the diagnosis, and to rule out conditions with overlapping symptoms. these tests may include screening tests to detect antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (gad) and amphiphysin, and an electromyography (emg) which records electrical activity in skeletal muscles. about 60% to 80% of affected people have autoantibodies against gad. although the absence of gad antibodies does not rule out sps, the presence of high levels of gad antibodies in appropriate people strongly supports the diagnosis. an emg typically shows continuous motor activity, which is characteristic of sps. very high levels of gad antibodies and characteristic emg findings will confirm the diagnosis in the majority of people with sps. additional laboratory testing may also be used to support a diagnosis of sps, such as hemoglobin a1c (due to association with diabetes mellitus); complete blood count (due to association with pernicious anemia); comprehensive metabolic profile; and thyroid-stimulating hormone (due to association with thyroiditis). lumbar puncture should be obtained in people with symptoms consistent with sps to rule out other causes. oligoclonal bands can be seen in about two thirds of affected people who are antibody-positive."
how to diagnose prothrombin thrombophilia ?,"what kind of tests can determine if an individual has, or is a carrier of, prothrombin thrombophilia? no clinical signs or symptoms are specific for prothrombin thrombophilia. a confirmed diagnosis of this condition requires specific genetic testing via dna analysis of the f2 gene, which provides instructions for making the protein prothrombin. the test identifies the presence of a common change (mutation) called 20210g>a. an individual can be a heterozygote (having one mutated copy of the f2 gene) or a homozygote (having two mutated copies). most heterozygotes have a mildly elevated plasma concentration of prothrombin (which can be measured in a blood test) that is approximately 30% higher than normal. however, these values can vary greatly, and the range of prothrombin concentrations in heterozygotes overlaps significantly with the normal range. therefore, plasma concentration of prothrombin is not reliable for diagnosis of this condition. individuals interested in learning more about testing for prothrombin thrombophilia should speak with a genetics professional or other healthcare provider."

what is (are) mccune albright syndrome ?,"mccune-albright syndrome (mas) is a disease that affects the bones, skin, and several hormone-producing (endocrine) tissues. it is characterized by replacement of normal bone tissue with areas of abnormal fibrous growth (fibrous dysplasia); patches of abnormal skin coloring with jagged borders (cafe-au-lait spots); and abnormalities in the glands that regulate the body's rate of growth, sexual development, and other metabolic functions (multiple endocrine dysfunction). mas is caused by a change (mutation) in the gnas gene that occurs by chance very early in development. as a result, some of the body's cells have a normal version of the gnas gene, while other cells have the mutated version. this phenomenon is called mosaicism. the severity of mas and its features depend on the number and location of cells that have the mutated gnas gene. because mas occurs by chance, it is not inherited or passed down from one generation to the next."

what are the treatments for schimke immunoosseous dysplasia ?,"how might schimke immunoosseous dysplasia be treated? treatment of schimke immunoosseous dysplasia (siod) is based on addressing individual symptoms as they develop. renal transplantation can treat the renal disease, and bone marrow transplantation has been done to treat the immunodeficiency. blood thinning medications can transiently improve blood flow through the atherosclerotic arteries but do not provide enduring relief from cerebral ischemia. treatment with acyclovir and some antibacterial agents has been beneficial for preventing of reducing the frequency of opportunistic infections. more detailed information about treatment for siod can be found on the genereview's web site. click on the genereview link to read more."
what are the treatments for gorham's disease ?,"how might gorham disease be treated? no specific therapy exists for people with gorham's disease. certain treatments may be effective in some, but not others. several different methods are often used before finding one that is effective. in some cases, treatment may not be necessary. most people require intense treatment, especially if the disease has spread to other areas of the body or if there is extensive involvement in the spine and skull. treatment options include radiation therapy, steroids, and/or surgery that may involve bone grafting. other treatments might include biphosphonates (such as pamidronate or zoledronic acid) and alpha-2b interferon. these treatments have led to improvement of symptoms in some cases. more research is necessary to determine the long-term safety and effectiveness of these therapies in people with gorham's disease. all treatments (pharmacological and surgical) are all still considered to be experimental since there have been no studies done to examine the effectiveness of anything used to date. in general, no single treatment has been proven effective in stopping the progression of the disease."
what is (are) parkinson disease ?,"parkinson disease belongs to a group of conditions called movement disorders. the four main symptoms are tremor, or trembling in hands, arms, legs, jaw, or head; rigidity, or stiffness of the limbs and trunk; bradykinesia, or slowness of movement; and postural instability, or impaired balance. these symptoms usually begin gradually and worsen with time. as they become more pronounced, patients may have difficulty walking, talking, or completing other simple tasks. not everyone with one or more of these symptoms has parkinson disease, as the symptoms sometimes appear in other diseases as well. parkinson disease affects about 1 to 2 percent of people over the age of 60 years and the chance of developing parkinson disease increases as we age. although some parkinson disease cases appear to be hereditary most cases are sporadic and occur in people with no apparent history of the disorder in their family. when three or more people are affected in a family, especially if they are diagnosed at an early age (under 50 years) there may be a gene making this family more likely to develop the condition. currently, seven genes that cause some form of parkinson's disease have been identified. mutations (changes) in three known genes called snca (park1),uchl1 (park 5), and lrrk2 (park8) and another mapped gene (park3) have been reported in families with dominant inheritance. mutations in three known genes, park2 (park2), park7 (park7), and pink1 (park6) have been found in affected individuals who had siblings with the condition but whose parents did not have parkinson's disease (recessive inheritance). there is some research to suggest that these genes are also involved in early-onset parkinson's disease (diagnosed before the age of 30) or in dominantly inherited parkinson's disease but it is too early yet to be certain. however, in most cases inheriting a mutation will not cause someone to develop parkinson's disease because there may be additional genes and environmental factors determining who will get the condition, when they get it and how it affects them."
what are the treatments for peters plus syndrome ?,"what treatment is available for peters plus syndrome? treatment varies from person to person and is based on the extent of the disease. once a person has been diagnosed with peters plus syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended : eye examination growth hormone testing developmental assessment heart examination kidney examination head examination thyroid testing hearing assessment assessment by a ophthalmologist every three months or as indicated is recommended as well as regular developmental assessments. agents, like corticosteroids, should be avoided, as they increase the risk of glaucoma."
what is (are) satoyoshi syndrome ?,"satoyoshi syndrome is a rare condition characterized by progressive, painful, intermittent muscle spasms, diarrhea or unusual malabsorption, amenorrhea, alopecia universalis, short stature, and skeletal abnormalities. progressive painful intermittent muscle spasms usually start between 6 to 15 years of age. alopecia universalis also appears around age 10. about half of affected individuals experience malabsorption, specifically of carbohydrates. the skeletal abnormalities may be secondary to muscle spasms. the main endocrine disorder is primary amenorrhea. all cases have apparently been sporadic, even when occurring in large families. the exact cause is unknown; but some researchers have speculated that satoyoshi syndrome is an autoimmune disorder."

how to diagnose spinocerebellar ataxia 2 ?,"is genetic testing available for spinocerebellar ataxia 2? yes. molecular genetic testing (analysis of dna) is needed for a diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (sca2). this testing detects abnormal cag trinucleotide repeat expansions in the atxn2 gene. affected people (or people who will later develop symptoms of sca2) have a copy of the atxn2 gene that has 33 or more cag repeats. this testing detects nearly 100% of cases of sca2. the genetic testing registry (gtr) provides information about the labs that offer genetic testing for sca2. the intended audience for the gtr is health care providers and researchers. therefore, patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional."
what is (are) 16q24.3 microdeletion syndrome ?,"16q24.3 microdeletion syndrome is a chromosome abnormality that can affect many parts of the body. people with this condition are missing a small piece (deletion) of chromosome 16 at a location designated q24.3. signs and symptoms may include developmental delay, characteristic facial features, seizures and autism spectrum disorder. chromosome testing of both parents can provide more information on whether or not the microdeletion was inherited. in most cases, parents do not have any chromosomal anomaly. however, sometimes one parent has a balanced translocation where a piece of a chromosome has broken off and attached to another one with no gain or loss of genetic material. the balanced translocation normally does not cause any signs or symptoms, but it increases the risk for having an affected child with a chromosomal anomaly like a microdeletion. treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. to learn more about chromosomal anomalies in general, please visit our gard webpage on chromosome disorders."
what is (are) mucoepidermoid carcinoma ?,"mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a type of cancer of the salivary glands. salivary gland cancer is diagnosed in 2-3 individuals per 100,000 people each year, and 30-35% of these are mucoepidermoid carcinomas. mucoepidermoid carcinoma develops when a cell randomly acquires changes (mutations) in genes that regulate how the cell divides such that it begins to grow quickly, forming a cluster of cells (a mass or lump). the earliest signs of a mucoepidermoid carcinoma may include a lump in the face, neck, or mouth; numbness, weakness, or pain in part of the face; or difficulty swallowing. treatment often begins with surgery to remove the entire tumor. in some cases, radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy may be used after surgery to ensure that no cancer cells remain in the body."
what is (are) cerulean cataract ?,"cerulean cataracts are opaque areas that develop in the lens of the eye that often have a bluish or whitish color. they may be present at birth or develop in very early childhood, but may not be diagnosed until adulthood. they are usually bilateral and progressive. infants can be asymptomatic, but may also be visually impaired from birth and develop nystagmus and amblyopia. in adulthood, the cataracts may progress, making lens removal necessary. cerulean cataracts may be caused by mutations in several genes, including the crybb2, crygd, and maf genes, and are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. no treatment is known to prevent cerulean cataracts, but frequent evaluations and cataract surgery are typically required to prevent amblyopia as the opacities progress."
what are the treatments for cerulean cataract ?,"how might cerulean cataracts be treated? no treatment is known to prevent cerulean cataracts, and there is currently no cure for the condition. frequent eye evaluations and eventual cataract surgery are typically required to prevent amblyopia (vision loss) as the opacities progress. the symptoms of early cataracts may be improved with new eyeglasses, brighter lighting, anti-glare sunglasses, or magnifying lenses. however, if these measures do not help, surgery is often the only effective treatment. surgery involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with an artificial lens. surgery is often considered when vision loss regularly interferes with everyday activities, such as driving, reading, or watching tv."
what is (are) pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy ?,"pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy is a condition that involves seizures beginning in infancy or, in some cases, before birth. those affected typically experience prolonged seizures lasting several minutes (status epilepticus). these seizures involve muscle rigidity, convulsions, and loss of consciousness (tonic-clonic seizures). anticonvulsant drugs, which are usually given to control seizures, are ineffective in people with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy. instead, people with this type of seizure are medically treated with large daily doses of pyridoxine (a type of vitamin b6 found in food). mutations in the aldh7a1 gene cause pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy. this gene is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."
what is (are) postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome ?,"postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (pots) is a rare condition that is primarily characterized by orthostatic intolerance (an excessively reduced volume of blood returns to the heart when moving from a lying down to a standing position). orthostatic intolerance is generally associated with lightheadedness and/or fainting that is typically relieved by lying down again. in people with pots, these symptoms are also accompanied by a rapid increase in heartbeat. although pots can affect men and women of all ages, most cases are diagnosed in women between the ages of 15 and 50. the exact underlying cause of pots is currently unknown. however, episodes often begin after a pregnancy, major surgery, trauma, or a viral illness and may increase right before a menstrual period. treatment aims to relieve low blood volume and/or regulate circulatory problems that could be causing the condition."
what are the symptoms of limbic encephalitis ?,"what symptoms are associated with limbic encephalitis? although the symptoms of the condition may vary from person to person, the cardinal sign of limbic encephalitis is severe impairment of short-term memory, with most patients having difficulties in recall. a large variety of symptoms may be associated with limbic encephalitis such as anterograde amnesia (the inability to store new memories after the onset of the condition), anxiety, depression, irritability, personality change, acute confusional state, hallucinations and seizures. other possible symptoms may include obsessiveness, hyperthermia (increase in body temperature), weight change, hypersomnia, endocrine dysfunction, aphasia, and apraxia. the symptoms associated with limbic encephalitis can develop over a few days, weeks, or months. it is important to note the neurological symptoms generally precede diagnosis of the malignancy in 60%-75% of patients that have paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis."
what is (are) charcot-marie-tooth disease type 1a ?,charcot-marie-tooth disease type 1a (cmt1a) is a type of inherited neurological disorder that affects the peripheral nerves. affected individuals experience weakness and wasting (atrophy) of the muscles of the lower legs beginning in adolescence; later they experience hand weakness and sensory loss. cmt1a is caused by having an extra copy (a duplication) of the pmp22 gene. it is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. treatment for this condition may include physical therapy; occupational therapy; braces and other orthopedic devices; orthopedic surgery; and pain medications.
what is (are) aicardi-goutieres syndrome type 5 ?,"aicardi-goutieres syndrome is an inherited condition that mainly affects the brain, immune system, and skin. it is characterized by early-onset severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy) that usually results in severe intellectual and physical disability. additional symptoms may include epilepsy, painful, itchy skin lesion (chilblains), vision problems, and joint stiffness. symptoms usually progress over several months before the disease course stabilizes. there are six different types of aicardi-goutieres syndrome, which are distinguished by the gene that causes the condition: trex1, rnaseh2a, rnaseh2b, rnaseh2c, samhd1, and adar genes. most cases are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, although rare autosomal dominant cases have been reported. treatment is symptomatic and supportive."

what are the treatments for prader-willi syndrome ?,"how might prader-willi syndrome be treated? a multidisciplinary team approach is ideal for the treatment of people with prader-willi syndrome (pws). early diagnosis, early multidisciplinary care, and growth hormone treatment have greatly improved the quality of life of many affected children. in general, management of this condition depends on the affected person's age and symptoms. when a diagnosis of pws is made, several evaluations are needed to assess the extent of the condition. for example, newborns should be assessed for sucking problems; infants should be assessed for development; and young children should have a vision exam. all males should be evaluated for the presence of cryptorchidism. other associated conditions for which evaluations may be recommended include hypothyroidism, scoliosis, behavioral problems, psychosis, and respiratory problems and sleep issues. in infants, special feeding techniques may be needed. young children often need early intervention, including physical therapy for muscle strength and reaching physical milestones, and speech therapy for language issues. cryptorchidism may resolve on its own but usually requires hormonal and/or surgical treatment. when excessive eating begins and weight percentiles increase, affected children should be on a program of a well-balanced diet, exercise, and close supervision with food. a consultation with a dietitian is recommended. behavioral problems may be addressed with special behavioral management programs. serotonin uptake inhibitors have helped many affected teenagers and adults, particularly those with obsessive-compulsive symptoms. growth hormone treatment can normalize height, increase lean body mass, increase mobility, and decrease fat mass. controlled trials of growth hormone therapies have shown significant benefit from infancy through adulthood. benefits may include an increase in language and cognitive skills, and better motor performance. sex hormone replacement helps to produce secondary sex characteristics (those that develop during puberty) but is somewhat controversial due to possible behavior problems in males, risk of stroke, and hygiene concerns related to menstruation in females. clinical trials investigating potential treatment options for people with pws are ongoing. clinicaltrials.gov provides patients, family members, and members of the public with current information on clinical research studies. people interested in participating in clinical trials are encouraged to visit this site to determine if any trials would be helpful. use each study's contact information to learn more. you can view a list of clinical trials for pws here. to learn more about how to find and participate in a research study, clinical trial, or patient registry, view our get involved in research page. additional information on this topic can be found at the links below. foundation for prader-willi research - diagnosis & treatment genereviews - prader-willi syndrome medscape - prader-willi syndrome"

what are the symptoms of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency? the signs and symptoms of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (dld) deficiency can vary widely among affected people. early-onset dld deficiency typically appears in early infancy with decreased muscle tone (hypotonia), lethargy, and lactic acidosis. lactic acidosis can cause nausea, vomiting, severe breathing problems, and an abnormal heartbeat. symptoms typically occur in episodes that may be triggered by illness, injury, or other stresses on the body. affected infants often do not survive their initial episode or may die within the first few years of life during a recurrent episode. children who live beyond the first two to three years often have growth delays and neurological problems such as intellectual disability, spasticity, ataxia, and seizures. however, normal intellect has been reported in a few people with the early-onset form of dld deficiency. isolated liver involvement, which can range from hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) to life-threatening liver failure, can also occur in the newborn period, or as late as the 3rd decade of life. a few people with dld deficiency have become affected later in childhood with ataxia and dystonia, with normal cognitive development. rarely, affected people have muscle weakness (particularly during exercise) or a weakened heart muscle (cardiomyopathy). the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) aminoaciduria 90% cognitive impairment 50% gait disturbance 50% hepatomegaly 50% microcephaly 50% muscular hypotonia 50% hepatic failure 7.5% hypoglycemia 7.5% decreased liver function 5% elevated hepatic transaminases 5% ataxia - autosomal recessive inheritance - dystonia - encephalopathy - feeding difficulties - hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - lactic acidosis - lethargy - metabolic acidosis - seizures - variable expressivity - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what causes dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency ?,"what causes dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency? dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (dld) deficiency is caused by changes (mutations) in the dld gene. this gene gives the body instructions to make an enzyme called dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (dld). dld is one part of 3 different groups of enzymes that work together (enzyme complexes). these enzyme complexes are involved in breaking down amino acids commonly found in protein-rich foods, and in other reactions that help to convert energy from food into a form that our cells can use. mutations in the dld gene impair the function of dld, preventing the 3 enzyme complexes from functioning properly. this causes a build-up of molecules that are normally broken down, which in turn leads to tissue damage, lactic acidosis and other chemical imbalances. the brain is especially sensitive to the buildup of molecules and lack of cellular energy, which is why there are neurological problems associated with dld deficiency."

what causes primary carnitine deficiency ?,"what causes primary carnitine deficiency? mutations in the slc22a5 gene cause primary carnitine deficiency. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called octn2 that transports carnitine into cells. cells need carnitine to bring certain types of fats (fatty acids) into mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers within cells. fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. during periods of fasting, fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues. mutations in the slc22a5 gene result in an absent or dysfunctional octn2 protein. as a result, there is a shortage (deficiency) of carnitine within cells. this deficiency, as well as potential build-up of fatty acids within the cells, causes the signs and symptoms of the condition."
what causes hereditary spherocytosis ?,"what causes hereditary spherocytosis? hereditary spherocytosis may be caused by mutations in any one of several genes. the mutations that cause the condition result in the formation of spherical, overly rigid, misshapen red blood cells. the misshapen red blood cells, called spherocytes, are removed from circulation and taken to the spleen for destruction. within the spleen, the red blood cells break down (undergo hemolysis). the shortage of red blood cells in the blood circulation and the abundance of cells in the spleen are responsible for the signs and symptoms of this condition. mutations in the ank1 gene are responsible for about half of all cases of hereditary spherocytosis. the other genes associated with hereditary spherocytosis account for a smaller percentage of cases and include the epb42, slc4a1, spta1, and sptb genes."

what is (are) spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita ?,spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita is an inherited disorder of bone growth that affects the bones of the spine and ends of the long bones in the arms and legs. features of this condition include short stature (dwarfism); a very short trunk and neck; abnormal curvature of the spine; barrel-shaped chest; shortened limbs; an abnormality of the hip joint; and problems with vision and hearing. arthritis and decreased joint mobility often develop early in life. more than 175 cases have been reported in the scientific literature. this condition is caused by mutations in the col2a1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. most cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no family history of the condition.
is spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita inherited ?,"how is spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita inherited? spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (sedc) is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. this means that one altered (mutated) gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. most cases of sedc do not result from inheriting it from a parent, however; the condition more commonly results from a random, new mutation in the gene occurring for the first time in an affected individual who does not have a history sedc in the family. in most of these cases, the risk to have another child with the condition is comparable to the risk for an individual in the general population to have a child with the condition. a few cases of autosomal recessive forms of sedc have been reported. germline mosaicism has also been reported for this condition. in this case, the parent does not have the mutated gene in all the cells of the body (and is not affected), but only in some of the germ cells (sperm or egg cells). the recurrence risk for a parent with germline mosaicism to have another affected child is difficult to predict. for conditions with autosomal dominant inheritance, studies have demonstrated that the risk to have another affected child may be low (about 1%), moderate (about 6%), or higher (about 30%), depending on the proportion of germ cells with the mutation as well as the disorder itself."

what are the treatments for klippel feil syndrome ?,"how might klippel-feil syndrome be treated? there is no cure for klippel feil syndrome (kfs); treatment is generally symptomatic and supportive. management depends on the features and severity in each person, and can be life-long. careful evaluation, consistent follow-up, and coordination with various specialists are needed to improve outcome and make sure that no related diagnosis is missed. there are various conservative therapies available, including the use of cervical collars, braces, traction, physical therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), and various pain medications. however, for many people with kfs, symptoms are progressive due to degenerative changes that occur in the spine. surgery may be indicated for a variety of reasons, including persistent pain; neurologic deficits; cervical or craniocervical instability; constriction of the spinal cord; or to correct severe scoliosis. some people with kfs may need surgery to repair other skeletal abnormalities, or those related to the heart, kidneys, ears, eyes, or other parts of the body. those at an increased risk for neurological complications should be regularly monitored by their health care providers and may be advised to avoid activities that could lead to trauma or injury to cervical vertebrae."
how to diagnose waardenburg syndrome ?,"how is waardenburg syndrome diagnosed? a diagnosis of waardenburg syndrome (ws) is made based on signs and symptoms present. in 1992, the waardenburg consortium proposed diagnostic criteria, which includes both major and minor criteria. a clinical diagnosis of ws type 1 (the most common type) needs 2 major, or 1 major and 2 minor criteria. major criteria: congenital sensorineural hearing loss iris pigmentary (coloration) abnormality, such as heterochromia iridis (complete, partial, or segmental); pale blue eyes (isohypochromia iridis); or pigmentary abnormalities of the fundus (part of the eye opposite the pupil) abnormalities of hair pigmentation, such as white forelock (lock of hair above the forehead), or loss of hair color dystopia canthorum lateral displacement of inner angles (canthi) of the eyes (in ws types 1 and 3 only) having a 1st degree relative with waardenburg syndrome minor criteria: congenital leukoderma (hypopigmented patches of skin) synophrys (connected eyebrows or ""unibrow"") or medial eyebrow flare broad or high nasal bridge (uppermost part of the nose) hypoplasia of the nostrils premature gray hair (under age 30) ws type 2 has similar features to ws type 1, but the inner canthi are normal (no dystopia cantorum present). ws type 3 also has similar features to ws type 1, but is additionally characterized by musculoskeletal abnormalities such as muscle hypoplasia (underdevelopment); flexion contractures (inability to straighten joints); or syndactyly (webbed or fused fingers or toes). ws type 4 has similar features to ws type 2, but with hirschsprung disease (a condition resulting from missing nerve cells in the muscles of part or all of the large intestine)."

what is (are) spinocerebellar ataxia 3 ?,"spinocerebellar ataxia 3 is a rare movement disorder that is characterized by ataxia, clumsiness and weakness in the arms and legs, spasticity, a staggering lurching walk easily mistaken for drunkenness, difficulty with speech and swallowing, and involuntary eye movements sometimes accompanied by double vision, and bulging eyes. some patients have dystonia or symptoms similar to those of parkinson's disease. others have twitching of the face or tongue, neuropathy, or problems with urination and the autonomic nervous system. symptoms can begin any time between childhood and about 70 years of age. spinocerebellar ataxia 3 is a progressive disease, meaning that symptoms get worse with time. life expectancy ranges from the mid-thirties for those with severe forms of the disorder to a normal life expectancy for those with mild forms. spinocerebellar ataxia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the ataxin-3 gene (atxn3)."
"what is (are) parasites - lice - pubic ""crab"" lice ?","also called crab lice or ""crabs,"" pubic lice are parasitic insects found primarily in the pubic or genital area of humans. pubic lice infestation is found worldwide and occurs in all races, ethnic groups, and levels of society."
who is at risk for parasites - angiostrongyliasis (also known as angiostrongylus infection)? ?,"angiostrongylus cantonensis angiostrongylus cantonensis, also known as the rat lungworm, is a parasitic nematode (worm) that is transmitted between rats and mollusks (such as slugs or snails) in its natural life cycle. other animals that become infected such as freshwater shrimp, land crabs, frogs, and planarians of the genus platydemus, are transport hosts that are not required for reproduction of the parasite but might be able to transmit infection to humans if eaten raw or undercooked. humans are accidental hosts who do not transmit infection to others. most cases of infection are diagnosed in southeast asia and the pacific basin, but the parasite has also been found in australia, some areas of africa, the caribbean, hawaii and louisiana. outbreaks of human angiostrongyliasis have involved a few to hundreds of persons; over 2,800 cases have been reported in the literature from approximately 30 countries. it is likely that the parasite has been spread by rats transported on ships and by the introduction of mollusks such as the giant african land snail (achatina fulica). in addition, the semi-slug, parmarion martensi (native of southeast asia)has spread in regions of hawaii and is found to often be infected with a. cantonensis, and the freshwater snail pomacea canaliculata (native of south america) has been introduced into taiwan and china and has been implicated in outbreaks of disease in those countries. risk factors for infection with a. cantonensis include the ingestion of raw or undercooked infected snails or slugs; or pieces of snails and slugs accidentally chopped up in vegetables, vegetable juices, or salads; or foods contaminated by the slime of infected snails or slugs. it is possible that ingestion of raw or undercooked transport hosts (freshwater shrimp, land crabs, frogs, etc. ) can result in human infection, though this is less certain. in addition, contamination of the hands during the preparation of uncooked infected snails or slugs could lead to ingestion of the parasite. angiostrongylus costaricensis angiostrongylus costaricensis is a parasitic nematode (worm) that resides in rodents and uses mollusks, such as slugs, as an intermediate host. rats, such as the cotton rat, transmit the larvae through their feces. slugs then ingest the larvae. humans are accidental hosts of the parasite. the parasite is not able to complete its life cycle in humans and eventually dies in the abdomen. human infection principally occurs in latin america and the caribbean, with a few cases suspected in the united states and in the republic of congo. the organism is also found in animals in the southern u.s. (texas). risk factors for infection with a. costaricensis are not well established but are likely to be ingestion of infected slugs or raw vegetables or vegetable juices contaminated with slugs or their slime, which can contain a. costaricensis larvae. the infection of transport hosts, which are not essential to the lifecycle of the parasite, has not been identified and any role in human infection is not known, in contrast to a. cantonensis. some reports have shown the case rate to be higher in children 6 to 12 years of age, males, and in persons of higher socioeconomic status. there has been one food-related outbreak in guatemala that affected primarily adults."
what is (are) parasites - lice - body lice ?,"body lice are parasitic insects that live on clothing and bedding used by infested persons. body lice frequently lay their eggs on or near the seams of clothing. body lice must feed on blood and usually only move to the skin to feed. body lice exist worldwide and infest people of all races. body lice infestations can spread rapidly under crowded living conditions where hygiene is poor (the homeless, refugees, victims of war or natural disasters). in the united states, body lice infestations are found only in homeless transient populations who do not have access to bathing and regular changes of clean clothes. infestation is unlikely to persist on anyone who bathes regularly and who has at least weekly access to freshly laundered clothing and bedding."
who is at risk for parasites - cyclosporiasis (cyclospora infection)? ?,"people become infected with cyclospora by ingesting sporulated oocysts, which are the infective form of the parasite. this most commonly occurs when food or water contaminated with feces is consumed. an infected person sheds unsporulated (immature, non-infective) cyclospora oocysts in the feces. the oocysts are thought to require days to weeks in favorable environmental conditions to sporulate (become infective). therefore, direct person-to-person transmission is unlikely, as is transmission via ingestion of newly contaminated food or water. more on: cyclospora biology geographic distribution cyclosporiasis occurs in many countries, but it seems to be most common in tropical and subtropical regions. in areas where cyclosporiasis has been studied, the risk for infection is seasonal. however, no consistent pattern has been identified regarding the time of year or the environmental conditions, such as temperature or rainfall. in the united states, foodborne outbreaks of cyclosporiasis since the mid-1990s have been linked to various types of imported fresh produce, including raspberries, basil, snow peas, and mesclun lettuce; no commercially frozen or canned produce has been implicated. u.s. cases of infection also have occurred in persons who traveled to cyclospora-endemic areas. to reduce the risk for infection, travelers should take precautions, such as those recommended in cdc's health information for international travel (yellow book). travelers also should be aware that treatment of water or food with chlorine or iodine is unlikely to kill cyclospora oocysts."
who is at risk for parasites - toxocariasis (also known as roundworm infection)? ?,"infected dogs and cats shed toxocara eggs in their feces into the environment. once in the environment, it takes 2 to 4 weeks for toxocara larvae to develop and for the eggs to become infectious. humans or other animals can be infected by accidentally ingesting toxocara eggs. for example, humans can become infected if they work with dirt and accidentally ingest dirt containing toxocara eggs. although rare, people can be infected by eating undercooked or raw meat from an infected animal such as a lamb or rabbit. because dogs and cats are frequently found where people live, there may be large numbers of infected eggs in the environment. once in the body, the toxocara eggs hatch and roundworm larvae can travel in the bloodstream to different parts of the body, including the liver, heart, lungs, brain, muscles, or eyes. most infected people do not have any symptoms. however, in some people, the toxocara larvae can cause damage to these tissues and organs. the symptoms of toxocariasis, the disease caused by these migrating larvae, include fever, coughing, inflammation of the liver, or eye problems. a u.s. study in 1996 showed that 30% of dogs younger than 6 months deposit toxocara eggs in their feces; other studies have shown that almost all puppies are born already infected with toxocara canis. research also suggests that 25% of all cats are infected with toxocara cati. infection rates are higher for dogs and cats that are left outside for more time and allowed to eat other animals. in humans, it has been found that almost 14% of the u.s. population has been infected with toxocara. globally, toxocariasis is found in many countries, and prevalence rates can reach as high as 40% or more in parts of the world. there are several factors that have been associated with higher rates of infection with toxocara. people are more likely to be infected with toxocara if they own a dog. children and adolescents under the age of 20 are more likely to test positive for toxocara infection. this may be because children are more likely to eat dirt and play in outdoor environments, such as sandboxes, where dog and cat feces can be found. this infection is more common in people living in poverty. geographic location plays a role as well, because toxocara is more prevalent in hot, humid regions where eggs are kept viable in the soil."
how to prevent parasites - toxocariasis (also known as roundworm infection) ?,"controlling toxocara infection in dogs and cats will reduce the number of infectious eggs in the environment and reduce the risk of infection for people. have your veterinarian treat your dogs and cats, especially young animals, regularly for worms. this is especially important if your pets spend time outdoors and may become infected again. there are several things that you can do around your home to make you and your pets safer: - clean your pet’s living area at least once a week. feces should be either buried or bagged and disposed of in the trash. wash your hands after handling pet waste. - do not allow children to play in areas that are soiled with pet or other animal feces and cover sandboxes when not in use to make sure that animals do not get inside and contaminate them. - wash your hands with soap and warm water after playing with your pets or other animals, after outdoor activities, and before handling food. - teach children the importance of washing hands to prevent infection. - teach children that it is dangerous to eat dirt or soil. more on: handwashing toxocara eggs have a strong protective layer which makes the eggs able to survive in the environment for months or even years under the right conditions. many common disinfectants are not effective against toxocara eggs but extreme heat has been shown to kill the eggs. prompt removal of animal feces can help prevent infection since the eggs require 2 to 4 weeks to become infective once they are out of the animal."
what are the treatments for chapare hemorrhagic fever (chhf) ?,"supportive therapy is important in chhf. this includes: - maintenance of hydration - management of shock - sedation - pain relief - usual precautions for patients with bleeding disorders - transfusions (when necessary) use of convalescent plasma therapy for treatment of ahf reduces mortality significantly and anecdotal evidence shows that the antiviral drug ribavirin may also hold promise for treating ahf. ribavirin has also been considered for preventing development of disease in people exposed to other arenaviruses. recovery the precise mortality of chhf is unknown and the only described case was fatal. patients who have suffered from other arenaviruses may continue to excrete virus in urine or semen for weeks after recovery. for this reason, these fluids should be monitored for infectivity, since convalescent patients have the potential to infect others (particularly sexual partners) via these fluids."
who is at risk for parasites - zoonotic hookworm? ?,"dog and cat hookworms are found throughout the world, especially in warmer climates. in the united states, zoonotic hookworms are found everywhere but more commonly along the east coast than the west coast. worldwide, zoonotic hookworms are found in tropical and subtropical regions where the parasite is better able to survive because of environmental conditions. however, there is one type of dog and cat hookworm that is more commonly found in cooler climates. the global burden of zoonotic hookworm in dogs and cats is not known; also, the amount of disease in people caused by these parasites is also unknown. cutaneous larva migrans (clm) is most often reported by returning travelers to tropical regions who have had soil and/or sand exposures in places where dogs and cats are likely to have hookworms. however, clm is likely causing significant problems for the people who live in less developed parts of the world, even though the disease is not reported regularly. in less developed areas of the world, dogs and cats are often free-ranging and have high rates of infection with hookworm which leads to widespread contamination of sand and soil. in a survey of a rural population in brazil, the prevalence of clm during the rainy season was 14.9% among children less than 5 years old and 0.7% among adults aged 20 years and older."
how to prevent parasites - zoonotic hookworm ?,"wearing shoes and taking other protective measures to avoid skin contact with sand or soil will prevent infection with zoonotic hookworms. travelers to tropical and subtropical climates, especially where beach exposures are likely, should be advised to wear shoes and use protective mats or other coverings to prevent direct skin contact with sand or soil. routine veterinary care of dogs and cats, including regular deworming, will reduce environmental contamination with zoonotic hookworm eggs and larvae. prompt disposal of animal feces prevents eggs from hatching and contaminating soil -- which makes it important for control of this parasitic infection."
what is (are) parasites - fascioliasis (fasciola infection) ?,"fascioliasis is an infectious disease caused by fasciola parasites, which are flat worms referred to as liver flukes. the adult (mature) flukes are found in the bile ducts and liver of infected people and animals, such as sheep and cattle. in general, fascioliasis is more common in livestock and other animals than in people. two fasciola species (types) infect people. the main species is fasciola hepatica, which is also known as ""the common liver fluke"" and ""the sheep liver fluke."" a related species, fasciola gigantica, also can infect people."
what is (are) parasites - cysticercosis ?,"cysticercosis is an infection caused by the larvae of the parasite taenia solium. this infection occurs after a person swallows tapeworm eggs. the larvae get into tissues such as muscle and brain, and form cysts there (these are called cysticerci). when cysts are found in the brain, the condition is called neurocysticercosis."
who is at risk for parasites - cysticercosis? ?,"cysticercosis is an infection caused by the larvae of the tapeworm, taenia solium. a person with an adult tapeworm, which lives in the person’s gut, sheds eggs in the stool. the infection with the adult tapeworm is called taeniasis. a pig then eats the eggs in the stool. the eggs develop into larvae inside the pig and form cysts (called cysticerci) in the pig's muscles or other tissues. the infection with the cysts is called cysticercosis. humans who eat undercooked or raw infected pork swallow the cysts in the meat. the larvae then come out of their cysts in the human gut and develop into adult tapeworms, completing the cycle. people get cysticercosis when they swallow eggs that are excreted in the stool of people with the adult tapeworm. this may happen when people - drink water or eat food contaminated with tapeworm eggs - put contaminated fingers in their mouth cysticercosis is not spread by eating undercooked meat. however, people get infected with tapeworms (taeniasis) by eating undercooked infected pork. people who have tapeworm infections can infect themselves with the eggs and develop cysticercosis (this is called autoinfection). they can also infect other people if they have poor hygiene and contaminate food or water that other people swallow. people who live with someone who has a tapeworm infection in their intestines have a much higher risk of getting cysticercosis than other people. human cysticercosis is found worldwide, especially in areas where pig cysticercosis is common. both taeniasis and cysticercosis are most often found in rural areas of developing countries with poor sanitation, where pigs roam freely and eat human feces. taeniasis and cysticercosis are rare among persons who live in countries where pigs are not raised and in countries where pigs do not have contact with human feces. although uncommon, cysticercosis can occur in people who have never traveled outside of the united states if they are exposed to tapeworm eggs. more on: taeniasis"

what are the symptoms of rocky mountain spotted fever (rmsf) ?,"the first symptoms of rocky mountain spotted fever (rmsf) typically begin 2-14 days after the bite of an infected tick. a tick bite is usually painless and about half of the people who develop rmsf do not remember being bitten. the disease frequently begins as a sudden onset of fever and headache and most people visit a healthcare provider during the first few days of symptoms. because early symptoms may be non-specific, several visits may occur before the diagnosis of rmsf is made and correct treatment begins. the following is a list of symptoms commonly seen with this disease, however, it is important to note that few people with the disease will develop all symptoms, and the number and combination of symptoms varies greatly from person to person. - fever - rash (occurs 2-5 days after fever, may be absent in some cases; see below) - headache - nausea - vomiting - abdominal pain (may mimic appendicitis or other causes of acute abdominal pain) - muscle pain - lack of appetite - conjunctival injection (red eyes) rmsf is a serious illness that can be fatal in the first eight days of symptoms if not treated correctly, even in previously healthy people. the progression of the disease varies greatly. patients who are treated early may recover quickly on outpatient medication, while those who experience a more severe course may require intravenous antibiotics, prolonged hospitalization or intensive care. rash while most people with rmsf (90%) have some type of rash during the course of illness, some people do not develop the rash until late in the disease process, after treatment should have already begun. approximately 10% of rmsf patients never develop a rash. it is important for physicians to consider rmsf if other signs and symptoms support a diagnosis, even if a rash is not present. a classic case of rmsf involves a rash that first appears 2-5 days after the onset of fever as small, flat, pink, non-itchy spots (macules) on the wrists, forearms, and ankles and spreads to include the trunk and sometimes the palms and soles. often the rash varies from this description and people who fail to develop a rash, or develop an atypical rash, are at increased risk of being misdiagnosed. the red to purple, spotted (petechial) rash of rmsf is usually not seen until the sixth day or later after onset of symptoms and occurs in 35-60% of patients with the infection. this is a sign of progression to severe disease, and every attempt should be made to begin treatment before petechiae develop. figure 1a and 1b: examples of an early-stage rash in an rmsf patient. long-term health problems patients who had a particularly severe infection requiring prolonged hospitalization may have long-term health problems caused by this disease. rickettsia rickettsii infects the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels. the damage that occurs in the blood vessels results in a disease process called a ""vasculitis"", and bleeding or clotting in the brain or other vital organs may occur. loss of fluid from damaged vessels can result in loss of circulation to the extremities and damaged fingers, toes or even limbs may ultimately need to be amputated. patients who suffer this kind of severe vasculitis in the first two weeks of illness may also be left with permanent long-term health problems such as profound neurological deficits, or damage to internal organs. those who do not have this kind of vascular damage in the initial stages of the disease typically recover fully within several days to months. infection in children children with rmsf infection may experience nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. children are less likely to report a headache, but more likely to develop an early rash than adults. other frequently observed signs and symptoms in children with rmsf are abdominal pain, altered mental status, and conjunctival injection. occasionally, symptoms like cough, sore throat, and diarrhea may be seen, and can lead to misdiagnosis. for more in-depth information about signs and symptoms of rmsf, please visit

rmsf vary from patient to patient and can easily resemble other, more common diseases. treatment for this disease is most effective at preventing death if started in the first five days of symptoms. diagnostic tests for this disease, especially tests based on the detection of antibodies, will frequently appear negative in the first 7-10 days of illness. due to the complexities of this disease and the limitations of currently available diagnostic tests, there is no test available at this time that can provide a conclusive result in time to make important decisions about treatment. for this reason, healthcare providers must use their judgment to treat patients based on clinical suspicion alone. healthcare providers may find important information in the patient’s history and physical examination that may aid clinical suspicion. information such as recent tick bites, exposure to high grass and tick-infested areas, contact with dogs, similar illnesses in family members or pets, or history of recent travel to areas of high incidence can be helpful in making the diagnosis. also, information about the presence of symptoms such as fever and rash may be helpful. the healthcare provider may also look at routine blood tests, such as a complete blood cell count or a chemistry panel. clues such as a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), low sodium levels (hyponatremia), or elevated liver enzyme levels are often helpful predictors of rmsf but may not be present in all patients. after a suspect diagnosis is made on clinical suspicion and treatment has begun, specialized laboratory testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of rmsf. laboratory confirmation r. rickettsii infects the endothelial cells that line blood vessels, and does not circulate in large numbers in the blood unless the patient has progressed to a very severe phase of infection. for this reason, blood specimens (whole blood, serum) are not always useful for detection of the organism through polymerase chain reaction (pcr) or culture. if the patient has a rash, pcr or immunohistochemical (ihc) staining can be performed on a skin biopsy taken from the rash site. this test can often deliver a rapid result. these tests have good sensitivity (70%) when applied to tissue specimens collected during the acute phase of illness and before antibiotic treatment has been started, but a negative result should not be used to guide treatment decisions. pcr, culture, and ihc can also be applied to autopsy specimens (liver, spleen, kidney, etc) collected after a patient dies. culture of r. rickettsii is only available at specialized laboratories; routine hospital blood cultures cannot detect r. rickettsii. during rmsf infection, a patient’s immune system develops antibodies to r. rickettsii, with detectable antibody titers usually observed by 7-10 days after illness onset. it is important to note that antibodies are not detectable in the first week of illness in 85% of patients, and a negative test during this time does not rule out rmsf as a cause of illness. the gold standard serologic test for diagnosis of rmsf is the indirect immunofluorescence assay (ifa) with r. rickettsii antigen, performed on two paired serum samples to demonstrate a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titers. the first sample should be taken as early in the disease as possible, preferably in the first week of symptoms, and the second sample should be taken 2 to 4 weeks later. in most rmsf cases, the first igg ifa titer is typically low or negative, and the second typically shows a significant (fourfold) increase in igg antibody levels. igm antibodies usually rise at the same time as igg near the end of the first week of illness and remain elevated for months or even years. also, igm antibodies are less specific than igg antibodies and more likely to result in a false positive. for these reasons, physicians requesting igm serologic titers should also request a concurrent igg titer. both igm and igg levels may remain elevated for months or longer after the disease has resolved, or may be detected in persons who were previously exposed to antigenically related organisms. up to 10% of currently healthy people in some areas may have elevated antibody titers due to past exposure to r. rickettsii or similar organisms. therefore, if only one sample is tested it can be difficult to interpret, whereas two paired samples taken weeks apart demonstrating a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titer provide the best evidence for a correct diagnosis of rmsf. for more in-depth information about testing, please visit http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm treatment doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages and should be initiated immediately whenever rmsf is suspected. use of antibiotics other than doxycycline is associated with a higher risk of fatal outcome. treatment is most effective at preventing death if doxycycline is started in the first 5 days of symptoms. therefore, treatment must be based on clinical suspicion alone and should always begin before laboratory results return or symptoms of severe disease, such as petechiae, develop. if the patient is treated within the first 5 days of the disease, fever generally subsides within 24-72 hours. in fact, failure to respond to doxycycline suggests that the patient’s condition might not be rmsf. severely ill patients may require longer periods before their fever resolves, especially if they have experienced damage to multiple organ systems. resistance to doxcycline or relapses in symptoms after the completion of the recommended course of treatment have not been documented. recommended dosage doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages: - adults: 100 mg every 12 hours - children under 45 kg (100 lbs): 2.2 mg/kg body weight given twice a day patients should be treated for at least 3 days after the fever subsides and until there is evidence of clinical improvement. standard duration of treatment is 7-14 days. treating children the use of doxycycline to treat suspected rmsf in children is standard practice recommended by both cdc and the aap committee on infectious diseases. use of antibiotics other than doxycycline increases the risk of patient death. unlike older tetracyclines, the recommended dose and duration of medication needed to treat rmsf has not been shown to cause staining of permanent teeth, even when five courses are given before the age of eight. healthcare providers should use doxycycline as the first-line treatment for suspected rocky mountain spotted fever in patients of all ages. other treatments in cases of life threatening allergies to doxycycline and in some pregnant patients for whom the clinical course of rmsf appears mild, chloramphenicol may be considered as an alternative antibiotic. oral forumulations of chloramphenicol are not available in the united states, and use of this drug carries the potential for other adverse risks, such as aplastic anemia and grey baby syndrome. furthermore, the risk for fatal outcome is elevated in patients who are treated with chloramphenicol compared to those treated with doxycycline. other antibiotics, including broad spectrum antibiotics are not effective against r. rickettsii, and the use of sulfa drugs may worsen infection. prophylaxis (preventive treatment) antibiotic treatment following a tick bite is not recommended as a means to prevent rmsf. there is no evidence this practice is effective, and may simply delay onset of disease. instead, persons who experience a tick bite should be alert for symptoms suggestive of tickborne illness and consult a physician if fever, rash, or other symptoms of concern develop. for more in-depth information about treatment, please visit http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm other considerations the clinical presentation for rmsf can also resemble other tickborne diseases, such as ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis. similar to rmsf, these infections respond well to treatment with doxycycline. healthcare providers should order diagnostic tests for additional agents if the clinical history and geographic association warrant. for more in-depth about other similar tickborne diseases, please visit

what are the treatments for parasites - scabies ?,"suggested general guidelines it is important to remember that the first time a person gets scabies they usually have no symptoms during the first 2 to 6 weeks they are infested; however they can still spread scabies during this time. treatment should be given to both the infested person and to household members and sexual contacts, particularly those who have had prolonged direct skin-to-skin contact with the infested person. both sexual and close personal contacts who have had direct prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an infested person within the preceding month should be examined and treated. all persons should be treated at the same time to prevent reinfestation. scabies may sometimes be sexually-acquired in adults, but is rarely sexually-acquired in children. bedding, clothing, and towels used by infested persons or their household, sexual, and close contacts (as defined above) anytime during the three days before treatment should be decontaminated by washing in hot water and drying in a hot dryer, by dry-cleaning, or by sealing in a plastic bag for at least 72 hours. scabies mites generally do not survive more than 2 to 3 days away from human skin. use of insecticide sprays and fumigants is not recommended. medications used to treat scabies products used to treat scabies are called scabicides because they kill scabies mites; some also kill mite eggs. scabicides used to treat human scabies are available only with a doctor’s prescription. no “over-the-counter” (non-prescription) products have been tested and approved to treat scabies. scabicide should be applied to all areas of the body from the neck down to the feet and toes. in addition, when treating infants and young children, scabicide also should be applied to their entire head and neck because scabies can affect their face, scalp, and neck, as well as the rest of their body. the scabicide should be applied to a clean body and left on for the recommended time before washing it off. clean clothing should be worn after treatment. the instructions contained in the box or printed on the label always should be followed carefully. always contact a doctor or pharmacist if unsure how to use a particular medicine. because the symptoms of scabies are due to a hypersensitivity reaction (allergy) to mites and their feces (scybala), itching still may continue for several weeks after treatment even if all the mites and eggs are killed. if itching still is present more than 2 to 4 weeks after treatment or if new burrows or pimple-like rash lesions continue to appear, retreatment may be necessary. skin sores that become infected should be treated with an appropriate antibiotic prescribed by a doctor."
who is at risk for parasites - trichuriasis (also known as whipworm infection)? ?,"whipworm is a soil-transmitted helminth (sth) and is the third most common roundworm of humans. whipworm causes an infection called trichuriasis and often occurs in areas where human feces is used as fertilizer or where defecation onto soil happens. the worms are spread from person to person by fecal-oral transmission or through feces-contaminated food. geographic distribution worldwide, infection occurs more frequently in areas with tropical weather and poor sanitation practices, and among children. in 2002, the estimated number of persons infected with whipworm was 1 billion. trichuriasis also occurs in the southern united states."
what is (are) parasites - leishmaniasis ?,"leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease that is found in parts of the tropics, subtropics, and southern europe. leishmaniasis is caused by infection with leishmania parasites, which are spread by the bite of infected sand flies. there are several different forms of leishmaniasis in people. the most common forms are cutaneous leishmaniasis, which causes skin sores, and visceral leishmaniasis, which affects several internal organs (usually spleen, liver, and bone marrow)."
how to prevent parasites - leishmaniasis ?,"no vaccines or drugs to prevent infection are available. the best way for travelers to prevent infection is to protect themselves from sand fly bites. to decrease the risk of being bitten, follow these preventive measures: avoid outdoor activities, especially from dusk to dawn, when sand flies generally are the most active. when outdoors (or in unprotected quarters): - minimize the amount of exposed (uncovered) skin. to the extent that is tolerable in the climate, wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and socks; and tuck your shirt into your pants. (see below about wearing insecticide-treated clothing.) - apply insect repellent to exposed skin and under the ends of sleeves and pant legs. follow the instructions on the label of the repellent. the most effective repellents generally are those that contain the chemical deet (n,n-diethylmetatoluamide). when indoors: - stay in well-screened or air-conditioned areas. - keep in mind that sand flies are much smaller than mosquitoes and therefore can get through smaller holes. - spray living/sleeping areas with an insecticide to kill insects. - if you are not sleeping in a well-screened or air-conditioned area, use a bed net and tuck it under your mattress. if possible, use a bed net that has been soaked in or sprayed with a pyrethroid-containing insecticide. the same treatment can be applied to screens, curtains, sheets, and clothing (clothing should be retreated after five washings). more on: insect bite prevention"
how to diagnose parasites - african trypanosomiasis (also known as sleeping sickness) ?,"the diagnosis of african trypanosomiasis is made through laboratory methods, because the clinical features of infection are not sufficiently specific. the diagnosis rests on finding the parasite in body fluid or tissue by microscopy. the parasite load in t. b. rhodesiense infection is substantially higher than the level in t. b. gambiense infection. t. b. rhodesiense parasites can easily be found in blood. they can also be found in lymph node fluid or in fluid or biopsy of a chancre. serologic testing is not widely available and is not used in the diagnosis, since microscopic detection of the parasite is straightforward. the classic method for diagnosing t. b. gambiense infection is by microscopic examination of lymph node aspirate, usually from a posterior cervical node. it is often difficult to detect t. b. gambiense in blood. concentration techniques and serial examinations are frequently needed. serologic testing is available outside the u.s. for t. b. gambiense; however, it normally is used for screening purposes only and the definitive diagnosis rests on microscopic observation of the parasite. all patients diagnosed with african trypanosomiasis must have their cerebrospinal fluid examined to determine whether there is involvement of the central nervous system, since the choice of treatment drug(s) will depend on the disease stage. the world health organization criteria for central nervous system involvement include increased protein in cerebrospinal fluid and a white cell count of more than 5. trypanosomes can often be observed in cerebrospinal fluid in persons with second stage infection. more on: resources for health professionals: diagnosis"
how to prevent crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever (cchf) ?,"agricultural workers and others working with animals should use insect repellent on exposed skin and clothing. insect repellants containing deet (n, n-diethyl-m-toluamide) are the most effective in warding off ticks. wearing gloves and other protective clothing is recommended. individuals should also avoid contact with the blood and body fluids of livestock or humans who show symptoms of infection. it is important for healthcare workers to use proper infection control precautions to prevent occupational exposure. an inactivated, mouse-brain derived vaccine against cchf has been developed and is used on a small scale in eastern europe. however, there is no safe and effective vaccine currently available for human use. further research is needed to develop these potential vaccines as well as determine the efficacy of different treatment options including ribavirin and other antiviral drugs."
how to prevent parasites - baylisascaris infection ?,"baylisascaris infection can be prevented by avoiding contact with raccoons and their feces. washing your hands after working or playing outdoors is good practice for preventing a number of diseases. do not keep, feed, or adopt wild animals, including raccoons, as pets. infection rarely causes symptoms in raccoons, so you cannot tell if a raccoon is infected by observing its behavior. roundworm eggs passed in the feces of infected raccoons are not visible to the naked eye. eggs can only be seen using a microscope. you may discourage raccoons from living in and around your home or parks by taking these steps: - prevent access to food - keep trash containers tightly closed - close off access to attics and basements - keep sandboxes covered when not in use (raccoons may use sandboxes as a latrine) - remove fish ponds -- they eat the fish and drink the water - eliminate water sources - remove bird feeders - clear brush so raccoons are not likely to make a den on your property stay away from areas and materials that might be contaminated by raccoon feces. raccoons typically defecate at the base of or in raised forks of trees, or on raised horizontal surfaces such as fallen logs, stumps, or large rocks. raccoon feces also can be found on woodpiles, decks, rooftops, and in attics, garages, and haylofts. feces usually are dark and tubular, have a pungent odor (usually worse than dog or cat feces), and often contain undigested seeds or other food items. if you have found a raccoon latrine near your home, cleaning the area may prevent possible infection. newly deposited eggs take at least 2-4 weeks to become infective. prompt removal and destruction of raccoon feces will reduce risk for exposure and possible infection. more on: raccoon latrine clean-up [pdf, 111 kb, 1 page] if you choose to clean the site yourself, care should be taken to avoid contaminating hands and clothes. - wear disposable gloves to help prevent cross contamination. - wear a n95-rated respirator if working in a confined space to prevent accidental ingestion of eggs or other harmful materials. - avoid stirring up dust and debris- you can lightly mist the latrine area with a little water from a spray bottle to reduce the amount of dust. - wear rubber boots that can be scrubbed or cover your shoes with disposable booties that can be thrown away, so that you do not bring eggs into your household. - feces and material contaminated with raccoon feces should be removed and burned, buried, or sent to a landfill. - most chemicals do not kill roundworm eggs; however, heat kills the eggs instantly. - treat feces-soiled decks, patios, and other surfaces with boiling water or a propane torch (please contact your local fire department for regulations and safety practices). to help further reduce the risk of possible infection, wash your hands well with soap and warm running water. clean/launder your clothes thoroughly with hot water and detergent. more on: handwashing if you are cleaning an indoor raccoon latrine and are not able to use a propane torch, use a damp (but not wet) sponge to wipe the area with hot soapy water. rinse your sponge frequently. after you are finished, flush dirty water down the toilet. place the sponge in a plastic bag and put the plastic bag in the garbage. contact your local animal control office for additional assistance. dogs dogs may be infected with adult b. procyonis roundworms, but may not show symptoms. have all pets de-wormed under a veterinarian's supervision and take precautions to avoid contact with their feces. exotic pets raccoons and dogs are not the only hosts of baylisascaris. b. procyonis infection has also been documented in kinkajous. other animals such as coatis may be susceptible. when wild animals are kept as pets, there can be a risk of disease transmission to humans."
what are the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs) ?,"chronic fatigue syndrome can be misdiagnosed or overlooked because its symptoms are similar to so many other illnesses. fatigue, for instance, can be a symptom for hundreds of illnesses. looking closer at the nature of the symptoms though, can help a doctor distinguish cfs from other illnesses. primary symptoms as the name chronic fatigue syndrome suggests, fatigue is one part of this illness. with cfs, however, the fatigue is accompanied by other symptoms. in addition, the fatigue is not the kind you might feel after a particularly busy day or week, after a sleepless night, or after a single stressful event. it's a severe, incapacitating fatigue that isn't improved by bed rest and that is often worsened by physical activity or mental exertion. it's an all-encompassing fatigue that can dramatically reduce a person's activity level and stamina. people with cfs function at a significantly lower level of activity than they were capable of before they became ill. the illness results in a substantial reduction in work-related, personal, social, and educational activities. the fatigue of cfs is accompanied by characteristic illness symptoms lasting at least 6 months. these symptoms include: - increased malaise (extreme exhaustion and sickness) following physical activity or mental exertion - problems with sleep - difficulties with memory and concentration - persistent muscle pain - joint pain (without redness or swelling) - headache - tender lymph nodes in the neck or armpit - sore throat other symptoms the symptoms listed above are the symptoms used to diagnose cfs. however, many cfs patients and patients in general may experience other symptoms, including: - brain fog (feeling like you're in a mental fog) - difficulty maintaining an upright position, dizziness, balance problems or fainting - allergies or sensitivities to foods, odors, chemicals, medications, or noise - irritable bowel - chills and night sweats - visual disturbances (sensitivity to light, blurring, eye pain) - depression or mood problems (irritability, mood swings, anxiety, panic attacks) it's important to tell your health care professional if you're experiencing any of these symptoms. you might have cfs, or you might have another treatable disorder. only a health care professional can diagnose cfs. what's the clinical course of cfs? the severity of cfs varies from patient to patient. some people can maintain fairly active lives. for most patients, however, cfs significantly limits their work, school, and family activities for periods of time. while symptoms vary from person to person in number, type, and severity, all cfs patients are limited in what they can do to some degree. cdc studies show that cfs can be as disabling as multiple sclerosis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, heart disease, end-stage renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), and similar chronic conditions. cfs often affects patients in cycles: patients will have periods of illness followed by periods of relative well-being. for some patients, symptoms may diminish or even go into complete remission; however, they often recur at a later point in time. this pattern of remission and relapse makes cfs especially hard for patients to manage. patients who are in remission may be tempted to overdo activities when they're feeling better, but this overexertion may actually contribute to a relapse. the percentage of cfs patients who recover is unknown, but there is some evidence to indicate that patients benefit when accompanying conditions are identified and treated and when symptoms are managed. high-quality health care is important."
what are the treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs) ?,"introduction managing chronic fatigue syndrome can be as complex as the illness itself. there is no cure, no prescription drugs have been developed specifically for cfs, and symptoms can vary a lot over time. thus, people with cfs should closely monitor their health and let their doctor know of any changes; and doctors should regularly monitor their patients' conditions and change treatment strategies as needed. a team approach that involves doctors and patients is one key to successfully managing cfs. patients and their doctors can work together to create an individualized treatment program that best meets the needs of the patient with cfs. this program should be based on a combination of therapies that address symptoms, coping techniques, and managing normal daily activities. cfs affects patients in different ways, and the treatment plan should be tailored to address symptoms that are most disruptive or disabling for each patient. helping the patient get relief from symptoms is the main goal of treatment. however, expecting a patient to return to usual activities should not be the immediate goal because the physical and mental exertion needed to try to reach that goal may aggravate the illness. because cfs is a complicated illness, its management may require input from a variety of medical professionals. primary care providers can develop effective treatment plans based on their experience in treating other illnesses. patients benefit when they can work in collaboration with a team of doctors and other health care professionals, who might also include rehabilitation specialists, mental health professionals, and physical or exercise therapists. difficulties of living with cfs living with chronic fatigue syndrome can be difficult. like other debilitating chronic illnesses, cfs can have a devastating impact on patients' daily lives and require them to make major lifestyle changes to adapt to many new limitations. common difficulties for cfs patients include problems coping with: - the changing and unpredictable symptoms - a decrease in stamina that interferes with activities of daily life - memory and concentration problems that seriously hurt work or school performance - loss of independence, livelihood, and economic security - alterations in relationships with partners, family members, and friends - worries about raising children feelings of anger, guilt, anxiety, isolation and abandonment are common in cfs patients. while it's ok to have such feelings, unresolved emotions and stress can make symptoms worse, interfere with prescription drug therapies, and make recovery harder."
who is at risk for kyasanur forest disease (kfd)? ?,"transmission to humans may occur after a tick bite or contact with an infected animal, most importantly a sick or recently dead monkey. no person-to-person transmission has been described. large animals such as goats, cows, and sheep may become infected with kfd but play a limited role in the transmission of the disease. these animals provide the blood meals for ticks and it is possible for infected animals with viremia to infect other ticks, but transmission of kfdv to humans from these larger animals is extremely rare. furthermore, there is no evidence of disease transmission via the unpasteurized milk of any of these animals."
who is at risk for kyasanur forest disease (kfd)? ?,"kfd has historically been limited to the western and central districts of karnataka state, india. however, in november 2012, samples from humans and monkeys tested positive for kfdv in the southernmost district of the state which neighbors tamil nadu state and kerala state, indicating the possibility of wider distribution of kfdv. additionally, a virus very similar to kfd virus (alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus) has been described in saudi arabia. people with recreational or occupational exposure to rural or outdoor settings (e.g., hunters, herders, forest workers, farmers) within karnataka state are potentially at risk for infection by contact with infected ticks. seasonality is another important risk factor as more cases are reported during the dry season, from november through june."
how to prevent parasites - loiasis ?,"there are no programs to control or eliminate loiasis in affected areas. your risk of infection may be less in areas where communities receive regular treatment for onchocerciasis or lymphatic filariasis. there are no vaccines that protect you from loiasis. if you are going to be in an area with loiasis for a long period of time, diethylcarbamazine (dec)—300mg taken once a week—can reduce your risk of infection. avoiding areas where the deerflies are found, such as muddy, shaded areas along rivers or around wood fires, may also reduce your risk of infection. you may reduce your risk of bites by using insect repellants that contain deet (n,n-diethyl-meta-toluamide) and wearing long sleeves and long pants during the day, which is when deerflies bite. treating your clothes with permethrin may also help. for a description of cdc's information for preventing insect bites, see cdc's yellow book. more on: insect bite prevention"
how to diagnose parasites - paragonimiasis (also known as paragonimus infection) ?,"the infection is usually diagnosed by identification of paragonimus eggs in sputum. the eggs are sometimes found in stool samples (coughed-up eggs are swallowed). a tissue biopsy is sometimes performed to look for eggs in a tissue specimen. specific and sensitive antibody tests based on p. westermani antigens are available through cdc, and serologic tests using a variety of techniques are available through commercial laboratories. more on: resources for health professionals: diagnosis more on: dpdx: paragonimus"
who is at risk for marburg hemorrhagic fever (marburg hf)? ?,"it is unknown how marburg virus first transmits from its animal host to humans; however, for the 2 cases in tourists visiting uganda in 2008, unprotected contact with infected bat feces or aerosols are the most likely routes of infection. after this initial crossover of virus from host animal to humans, transmission occurs through person-to-person contact. this may happen in several ways: direct contact to droplets of body fluids from infected persons, or contact with equipment and other objects contaminated with infectious blood or tissues. in previous outbreaks, persons who have handled infected non-human primates or have come in direct contact with their fluids or cell cultures have become infected. spread of the virus between humans has occurred in close environments and direct contacts. a common example is through caregivers in the home or in a hospital (nosocomial transmission)."
who is at risk for marburg hemorrhagic fever (marburg hf)? ?,"people who have close contact with african fruit bats, humans patients, or non-human primates infected with marburg virus are at risk. historically, the people at highest risk include family members and hospital staff who care for patients infected with marburg virus and have not used proper barrier nursing techniques. particular occupations, such as veterinarians and laboratory or quarantine facility workers who handle non-human primates from africa, may also be at increased risk of exposure to marburg virus. exposure risk can be higher for travelers visiting endemic regions in africa, including uganda and other parts of central africa, and have contact with fruit bats, or enter caves or mines inhabited by fruit bats."

what is botulism?,"botulism is a rare but serious paralytic illness caused by a nerve toxin that is produced by the bacterium clostridium botulinum and sometimes by strains of clostridium butyricum and clostridium baratii. there are five main kinds of botulism. foodborne botulism is caused by eating foods that contain the botulinum toxin. wound botulism is caused by toxin produced from a wound infected with clostridium botulinum. infant botulism is caused by consuming the spores of the botulinum bacteria, which then grow in the intestines and release toxin. adult intestinal toxemia (adult intestinal colonization) botulism is a very rare kind of botulism that occurs among adults by the same route as infant botulism. lastly, iatrogenic botulism can occur from accidental overdose of botulinum toxin. all forms of botulism can be fatal and are considered medical emergencies. foodborne botulism is a public health emergency because many people can be poisoned by eating a contaminated food."
what are the symptoms of botulism?,"the classic symptoms of botulism include double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, and muscle weakness. infants with botulism appear lethargic, feed poorly, are constipated, and have a weak cry and poor muscle tone. these are all symptoms of the muscle paralysis caused by the bacterial toxin. if untreated, these symptoms may progress to cause paralysis of the respiratory muscles, arms, legs, and trunk. in foodborne botulism, symptoms generally begin 18 to 36 hours after eating a contaminated food, but they can occur as early as 6 hours or as late as 10 days."
how can botulism be treated?,"the respiratory failure and paralysis that occur with severe botulism may require a patient to be on a breathing machine (ventilator) for weeks or months, plus intensive medical and nursing care. the paralysis slowly improves. botulism can be treated with an antitoxin which blocks the action of toxin circulating in the blood. antitoxin for infants is available from the california department of public health, and antitoxin for older children and adults is available through cdc.if given before paralysis is complete, antitoxin can prevent worsening and shorten recovery time. physicians may try to remove contaminated food still in the gut by inducing vomiting or by using enemas. wounds should be treated, usually surgically, to remove the source of the toxin-producing bacteria followed by administration of appropriate antibiotics. good supportive care in a hospital is the mainstay of therapy for all forms of botulism."
who is at risk for parasites - lice - head lice? ?,"in the united states, infestation with head lice (pediculus humanus capitis) is most common among preschool- and elementary school-age children and their household members and caretakers. head lice are not known to transmit disease; however, secondary bacterial infection of the skin resulting from scratching can occur with any lice infestation. getting head lice is not related to cleanliness of the person or his or her environment. head lice are mainly spread by direct contact with the hair of an infested person. the most common way to get head lice is by head-to-head contact with a person who already has head lice. such contact can be common among children during play at: - school, - home, and - elsewhere (e.g., sports activities, playgrounds, camp, and slumber parties). uncommonly, transmission may occur by: - wearing clothing, such as hats, scarves, coats, sports uniforms, or hair ribbons worn by an infested person; - using infested combs, brushes or towels; or - lying on a bed, couch, pillow, carpet, or stuffed animal that has recently been in contact with an infested person. reliable data on how many people get head lice each year in the united states are not available; however, an estimated 6 million to 12 million infestations occur each year in the united states among children 3 to 11 years of age. some studies suggest that girls get head lice more often than boys, probably due to more frequent head-to-head contact. in the united states, infestation with head lice is much less common among african-americans than among persons of other races. the head louse found most frequently in the united states may have claws that are better adapted for grasping the shape and width of some types of hair but not others."
how to prevent parasites - lice - head lice ?,"head lice are spread most commonly by direct head-to-head (hair-to-hair) contact. however, much less frequently they are spread by sharing clothing or belongings onto which lice have crawled or nits attached to shed hairs may have fallen. the risk of getting infested by a louse that has fallen onto a carpet or furniture is very small. head lice survive less than 1–2 days if they fall off a person and cannot feed; nits cannot hatch and usually die within a week if they are not kept at the same temperature as that found close to the scalp. the following are steps that can be taken to help prevent and control the spread of head lice: - avoid head-to-head (hair-to-hair) contact during play and other activities at home, school, and elsewhere (sports activities, playground, slumber parties, camp). - do not share clothing such as hats, scarves, coats, sports uniforms, hair ribbons, or barrettes. - do not share combs, brushes, or towels. disinfest combs and brushes used by an infested person by soaking them in hot water (at least 130°f) for 5–10 minutes. - do not lie on beds, couches, pillows, carpets, or stuffed animals that have recently been in contact with an infested person. - machine wash and dry clothing, bed linens, and other items that an infested person wore or used during the 2 days before treatment using the hot water (130°f) laundry cycle and the high heat drying cycle. clothing and items that are not washable can be dry-cleaned or sealed in a plastic bag and stored for 2 weeks. - vacuum the floor and furniture, particularly where the infested person sat or lay. however, spending much time and money on housecleaning activities is not necessary to avoid reinfestation by lice or nits that may have fallen off the head or crawled onto furniture or clothing. - do not use fumigant sprays or fogs; they are not necessary to control head lice and can be toxic if inhaled or absorbed through the skin. to help control a head lice outbreak in a community, school, or camp, children can be taught to avoid activities that may spread head lice."
how common is infection with y. enterocolitica for yersinia ?,"y. enterocolitica is a relatively infrequent cause of diarrhea and abdominal pain. based on data from the foodborne diseases active surveillance network (foodnet), which measures the burden and sources of specific diseases over time, approximately one culture-confirmed y. enterocolitica infection per 100,000 persons occurs each year. children are infected more often than adults, and the infection is more common in the winter."
how to prevent parasites - taeniasis ?,"one way to prevent taeniasis is to cook meat to safe temperatures. a food thermometer should be used to measure the internal temperature of cooked meat. do not sample meat until it is cooked. usda recommends the following for meat preparation. - for whole cuts of meat (excluding poultry) - cook to at least 145° f (63° c) as measured with a food thermometer placed in the thickest part of the meat, then allow the meat to rest* for three minutes before carving or consuming. - for ground meat (excluding poultry) - cook to at least 160° f (71° c); ground meats do not require a rest* time. *according to usda, ""a 'rest time' is the amount of time the product remains at the final temperature, after it has been removed from a grill, oven, or other heat source. during the three minutes after meat is removed from the heat source, its temperature remains constant or continues to rise, which destroys pathogens."" more on: fight bac: safe food handling"
who is at risk for parasites - hookworm? ?,"hookworm is a soil-transmitted helminth (sth) and is one of the most common roundworm of humans. infection is caused by the nematode parasites necator americanus and ancylostoma duodenale. hookworm infections often occur in areas where human feces are used as fertilizer or where defecation onto soil happens. geographic distribution the geographic distributions of the hookworm species that are intestinal parasites in human, ancylostoma duodenale and necator americanus, are worldwide in areas with warm, moist climates and are widely overlapping. necator americanus was widespread in the southeastern united states until the early 20th century."
how to prevent parasites - toxoplasmosis (toxoplasma infection) ?,"people who are healthy should follow the guidelines below to reduce risk of toxoplasmosis. if you have a weakened immune system, please see guidelines for immunocompromised persons. reduce risk from food to prevent risk of toxoplasmosis and other infections from food: - freeze meat for several days at sub-zero (0° f) temperatures before cooking to greatly reduce chance of infection. - peel or wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly before eating. - wash cutting boards, dishes, counters, utensils, and hands with hot soapy water after contact with raw meat, poultry, seafood, or unwashed fruits or vegetables. more on: handwashing the u.s. government and the meat industry continue their efforts to reduce t. gondii in meat. reduce risk from the environment to prevent risk of toxoplasmosis from the environment: - avoid drinking untreated drinking water. - wear gloves when gardening and during any contact with soil or sand because it might be contaminated with cat feces that contain toxoplasma. wash hands with soap and warm water after gardening or contact with soil or sand. - teach children the importance of washing hands to prevent infection. - keep outdoor sandboxes covered. - feed cats only canned or dried commercial food or well-cooked table food, not raw or undercooked meats. - change the litter box daily if you own a cat. the toxoplasma parasite does not become infectious until 1 to 5 days after it is shed in a cat's feces. if you are pregnant or immunocompromised: - avoid changing cat litter if possible. if no one else can perform the task, wear disposable gloves and wash your hands with soap and warm water afterwards. - keep cats indoors. - do not adopt or handle stray cats, especially kittens. do not get a new cat while you are pregnant."
what is (are) acinetobacter in healthcare settings ?,"acinetobacter [asz−in−ée−toe–back−ter] is a group of bacteria commonly found in soil and water. while there are many types or “species” of acinetobacter and all can cause human disease, acinetobacter baumannii [asz−in−ée−toe–back−ter boe-maa-nee-ie] accounts for about 80% of reported infections. outbreaks of acinetobacter infections typically occur in intensive care units and healthcare settings housing very ill patients. acinetobacter infections rarely occur outside of healthcare settings."
how to prevent acinetobacter in healthcare settings ?,"acinetobacter can live on the skin and may survive in the environment for several days. careful attention to infection control procedures, such as hand hygiene and environmental cleaning, can reduce the risk of transmission."
what are the treatments for immune thrombocytopenia ?,"treatment for immune thrombocytopenia (itp) is based on how much and how often you're bleeding and your platelet count. adults who have mild itp may not need any treatment, other than watching their symptoms and platelet counts. adults who have itp with very low platelet counts or bleeding problems often are treated. the acute (short-term) type of itp that occurs in children often goes away within a few weeks or months. children who have bleeding symptoms, other than merely bruising (purpura), usually are treated. children who have mild itp may not need treatment other than monitoring and followup to make sure their platelet counts return to normal. medicines medicines often are used as the first course of treatment for both children and adults. corticosteroids (cor-ti-co-steer-roids), such as prednisone, are commonly used to treat itp. these medicines, called steroids for short, help increase your platelet count. however, steroids have many side effects. some people relapse (get worse) when treatment ends. the steroids used to treat itp are different from the illegal steroids that some athletes take to enhance performance. corticosteroids aren't habit-forming, even if you take them for many years. other medicines also are used to raise the platelet count. some are given through a needle inserted into a vein. these medicines include rituximab, immune globulin, and anti-rh (d) immunoglobulin. medicines also may be used with a procedure to remove the spleen called splenectomy (splee-neck-tuh-mee). if medicines or splenectomy don't help, two newer medicineseltrombopag and romiplostimcan be used to treat itp. removal of the spleen (splenectomy) if needed, doctors can surgically remove the spleen. this organ is located in the upper left abdomen. the spleen is about the size of a golf ball in children and a baseball in adults. the spleen makes antibodies (proteins) that help fight infections. in itp, these antibodies destroy platelets by mistake. if itp hasn't responded to medicines, removing the spleen will reduce the destruction of platelets. however, it also may raise your risk for infections. before you have the surgery, your doctor may give you vaccines to help prevent infections. if your spleen is removed, your doctor will explain what steps you can take to help avoid infections and what symptoms to watch for. other treatments platelet transfusions some people who have itp with severe bleeding may need to have platelet transfusions and be hospitalized. some people will need platelet transfusions before having surgery. for a platelet transfusion, donor platelets from a blood bank are injected into the recipient's bloodstream. this increases the platelet count for a short time. for more information about platelet transfusions, go to the health topics blood transfusion article. treating infections some infections can briefly lower your platelet count. treating the infection may help increase your platelet count and reduce bleeding problems. stopping medicines some medicines can lower your platelet count or cause bleeding. stopping the medicine can sometimes help raise your platelet count or prevent bleeding. for example, aspirin and ibuprofen are common medicines that increase the risk of bleeding. if you have itp, your doctor may suggest that you avoid these medicines."
what is (are) deep vein thrombosis ?,"espaol deep vein thrombosis (throm-bo-sis), or dvt, is a blood clot that forms in a vein deep in the body. blood clots occur when blood thickens and clumps together. most deep vein blood clots occur in the lower leg or thigh. they also can occur in other parts of the body. a blood clot in a deep vein can break off and travel through the bloodstream. the loose clot is called an embolus (em-bo-lus). it can travel to an artery in the lungs and block blood flow. this condition is called pulmonary embolism (pull-mun-ary em-bo-lizm), or pe. pe is a very serious condition. it can damage the lungs and other organs in the body and cause death. blood clots in the thighs are more likely to break off and cause pe than blood clots in the lower legs or other parts of the body. blood clots also can form in veins closer to the skin's surface. however, these clots won't break off and cause pe. the animation below shows a deep vein blood clot. click the ""start"" button to play the animation. written and spoken explanations are provided with each frame. use the buttons in the lower right corner to pause, restart, or replay the animation, or use the scroll bar below the buttons to move through the frames. the animation shows how a blood clot in a deep vein of the leg can break off, travel to the lungs, and block blood flow."
how to prevent deep vein thrombosis ?,"you can take steps to prevent deep vein thrombosis (dvt) and pulmonary embolism (pe). if you're at risk for these conditions: see your doctor for regular checkups. take all medicines as your doctor prescribes. get out of bed and move around as soon as possible after surgery or illness (as your doctor recommends). moving around lowers your chance of developing a blood clot. exercise your lower leg muscles during long trips. this helps prevent blood clots from forming. if you've had dvt or pe before, you can help prevent future blood clots. follow the steps above and: take all medicines that your doctor prescribes to prevent or treat blood clots follow up with your doctor for tests and treatment use compression stockings as your doctor directs to prevent leg swelling contact your doctor at once if you have any signs or symptoms of dvt or pe. for more information, go to ""what are the signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis?"" travel tips the risk of developing dvt while traveling is low. the risk increases if the travel time is longer than 4 hours or you have other dvt risk factors. during long trips, it may help to: walk up and down the aisles of the bus, train, or airplane. if traveling by car, stop about every hour and walk around. move your legs and flex and stretch your feet to improve blood flow in your calves. wear loose and comfortable clothing. drink plenty of fluids and avoid alcohol. if you have risk factors for dvt, your doctor may advise you to wear compression stockings while traveling. or, he or she may suggest that you take a blood-thinning medicine before traveling."
how to prevent high blood pressure ?,"healthy lifestyle habits, proper use of medicines, and regular medical care can prevent high blood pressure or its complications. preventing high blood pressure onset healthy lifestyle habits can help prevent high blood pressure from developing. it is important to check your blood pressure regularly. children should have their blood pressure checked starting at 3 years of age. if prehypertension is detected, it should be taken seriously to avoid progressing to high blood pressure. preventing worsening high blood pressure or complications if you have been diagnosed with high blood pressure, it is important to obtain regular medical care and to follow your prescribed treatment plan, which will include healthy lifestyle habit recommendations and possibly medicines. not only can healthy lifestyle habits prevent high blood pressure from occurring, but they can reverse prehypertension and help control existing high blood pressure or prevent complications and long-term problems associated with this condition, such as coronary heart disease, stroke, or kidney disease."
what is (are) cystic fibrosis ?,"cystic fibrosis (sis-tik fi-bro-sis), or cf, is an inherited disease of the secretory (see-kreh-tor-ee) glands. secretory glands include glands that make mucus and sweat. ""inherited"" means the disease is passed from parents to children through genes. people who have cf inherit two faulty genes for the diseaseone from each parent. the parents likely don't have the disease themselves. cf mainly affects the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, sinuses, and sex organs. overview mucus is a substance made by tissues that line some organs and body cavities, such as the lungs and nose. normally, mucus is a slippery, watery substance. it keeps the linings of certain organs moist and prevents them from drying out or getting infected. if you have cf, your mucus becomes thick and sticky. it builds up in your lungs and blocks your airways. (airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs.) the buildup of mucus makes it easy for bacteria to grow. this leads to repeated, serious lung infections. over time, these infections can severely damage your lungs. the thick, sticky mucus also can block tubes, or ducts, in your pancreas (an organ in your abdomen). as a result, the digestive enzymes that your pancreas makes can't reach your small intestine. these enzymes help break down food. without them, your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. this can cause vitamin deficiency and malnutrition because nutrients pass through your body without being used. you also may have bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly from severe constipation, and pain or discomfort. cf also causes your sweat to become very salty. thus, when you sweat, you lose large amounts of salt. this can upset the balance of minerals in your blood and cause many health problems. examples of these problems include dehydration (a lack of fluid in your body), increased heart rate, fatigue (tiredness), weakness, decreased blood pressure, heat stroke, and, rarely, death. if you or your child has cf, you're also at higher risk for diabetes or two bone-thinning conditions called osteoporosis (os-te-o-po-ro-sis) and osteopenia (os-te-o-pee-nee-uh). cf also causes infertility in men, and the disease can make it harder for women to get pregnant. (the term ""infertility"" refers to the inability to have children.) outlook the symptoms and severity of cf vary. if you or your child has the disease, you may have serious lung and digestive problems. if the disease is mild, symptoms may not show up until the teen or adult years. the symptoms and severity of cf also vary over time. sometimes you'll have few symptoms. other times, your symptoms may become more severe. as the disease gets worse, you'll have more severe symptoms more often. lung function often starts to decline in early childhood in people who have cf. over time, damage to the lungs can cause severe breathing problems. respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in people who have cf. as treatments for cf continue to improve, so does life expectancy for those who have the disease. today, some people who have cf are living into their forties or fifties, or longer. early treatment for cf can improve your quality of life and increase your lifespan. treatments may include nutritional and respiratory therapies, medicines, exercise, and other treatments. your doctor also may recommend pulmonary rehabilitation (pr). pr is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems."
what is (are) holes in the heart ?,"holes in the heart are simple congenital (kon-jen-ih-tal) heart defects. congenital heart defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. these defects change the normal flow of blood through the heart. the heart has two sides, separated by an inner wall called the septum. with each heartbeat, the right side of the heart receives oxygen-poor blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs. the left side of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it to the body. the septum prevents mixing of blood between the two sides of the heart. however, some babies are born with holes in the upper or lower septum. a hole in the septum between the heart's two upper chambers is called an atrial septal defect (asd). a hole in the septum between the heart's two lower chambers is called a ventricular septal defect (vsd). asds and vsds allow blood to pass from the left side of the heart to the right side. thus, oxygen-rich blood mixes with oxygen-poor blood. as a result, some oxygen-rich blood is pumped to the lungs instead of the body. over the past few decades, the diagnosis and treatment of asds and vsds have greatly improved. children who have simple congenital heart defects can survive to adulthood. they can live normal, active lives because their heart defects close on their own or have been repaired."
who is at risk for fanconi anemia? ?,"fanconi anemia (fa) occurs in all racial and ethnic groups and affects men and women equally. in the united states, about 1 out of every 181 people is an fa carrier. this carrier rate leads to about 1 in 130,000 people being born with fa. two ethnic groups, ashkenazi jews and afrikaners, are more likely than other groups to have fa or be fa carriers. ashkenazi jews are people who are descended from the jewish population of eastern europe. afrikaners are white natives of south africa who speak a language called afrikaans. this ethnic group is descended from early dutch, french, and german settlers. in the united states, 1 out of 90 ashkenazi jews is an fa carrier, and 1 out of 30,000 is born with fa. major risk factors fa is an inherited diseasethat is, it's passed from parents to children through genes. at least 13 faulty genes are associated with fa. fa occurs if both parents pass the same faulty fa gene to their child. children born into families with histories of fa are at risk of inheriting the disorder. children whose mothers and fathers both have family histories of fa are at even greater risk. a family history of fa means that it's possible that a parent carries a faulty gene associated with the disorder. children whose parents both carry the same faulty gene are at greatest risk of inheriting fa. even if these children aren't born with fa, they're still at risk of being fa carriers. children who have only one parent who carries a faulty fa gene also are at risk of being carriers. however, they're not at risk of having fa."
what are the treatments for fanconi anemia ?,"doctors decide how to treat fanconi anemia (fa) based on a person's age and how well the person's bone marrow is making new blood cells. goals of treatment long-term treatments for fa can: cure the anemia. damaged bone marrow cells are replaced with healthy ones that can make enough of all three types of blood cells on their own. or treat the symptoms without curing the cause. this is done using medicines and other substances that can help your body make more blood cells for a limited time. screening and short-term treatment even if you or your child has fa, your bone marrow might still be able to make enough new blood cells. if so, your doctor might suggest frequent blood count checks so he or she can watch your condition. your doctor will probably want you to have bone marrow tests once a year. he or she also will screen you for any signs of cancer or tumors. if your blood counts begin to drop sharply and stay low, your bone marrow might be failing. your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to help your body fight infections. in the short term, he or she also may want to give you blood transfusions to increase your blood cell counts to normal levels. however, long-term use of blood transfusions can reduce the chance that other treatments will work. long-term treatment the four main types of long-term treatment for fa are: blood and marrow stem cell transplant androgen therapy synthetic growth factors gene therapy blood and marrow stem cell transplant a blood and marrow stem cell transplant is the current standard treatment for patients who have fa that's causing major bone marrow failure. healthy stem cells from another person, called a donor, are used to replace the faulty cells in your bone marrow. if you're going to receive stem cells from another person, your doctor will want to find a donor whose stem cells match yours as closely as possible. stem cell transplants are most successful in younger people who: have few or no serious health problems receive stem cells from a brother or sister who is a good donor match have had few or no previous blood transfusions during the transplant, you'll get donated stem cells in a procedure that's like a blood transfusion. once the new stem cells are in your body, they travel to your bone marrow and begin making new blood cells. a successful stem cell transplant will allow your body to make enough of all three types of blood cells. even if you've had a stem cell transplant to treat fa, youre still at risk for some types of blood cancer and cancerous solid tumors. your doctor will check your health regularly after the procedure. for more information about stem cell transplantsincluding finding a donor, having the procedure, and learning about the risksgo to the health topics blood and marrow stem cell transplant article. androgen therapy before improvements made stem cell transplants more effective, androgen therapy was the standard treatment for people who had fa. androgens are man-made male hormones that can help your body make more blood cells for long periods. androgens increase your red blood cell and platelet counts. they don't work as well at raising your white blood cell count. unlike a stem cell transplant, androgens don't allow your bone marrow to make enough of all three types of blood cells on its own. you may need ongoing treatment with androgens to control the effects of fa. also, over time, androgens lose their ability to help your body make more blood cells, which means you'll need other treatments. androgen therapy can have serious side effects, such as liver disease. this treatment also can't prevent you from developing leukemia (a type of blood cancer). synthetic growth factors your doctor may choose to treat your fa with growth factors. these are substances found in your body, but they also can be man-made. growth factors help your body make more red and white blood cells. growth factors that help your body make more platelets still are being studied. more research is needed on growth factor treatment for fa. early results suggest that growth factors may have fewer and less serious side effects than androgens. gene therapy researchers are looking for ways to replace faulty fa genes with normal, healthy genes. they hope these genes will make proteins that can repair and protect your bone marrow cells. early results of this therapy hold promise, but more research is needed. surgery fa can cause birth defects that affect the arms, thumbs, hips, legs, and other parts of the body. doctors may recommend surgery to repair some defects. for example, your child might be born with a ventricular septal defecta hole or defect in the wall that separates the lower chambers of the heart. his or her doctor may recommend surgery to close the hole so the heart can work properly. children who have fa also may need surgery to correct digestive system problems that can harm their nutrition, growth, and survival. one of the most common problems is an fa-related birth defect in which the trachea (windpipe), which carries air to the lungs, is connected to the esophagus, which carries food to the stomach. this can cause serious breathing, swallowing, and eating problems and can lead to lung infections. surgery is needed to separate the two organs and allow normal eating and breathing."
what causes mitral valve prolapse ?,"the exact cause of mitral valve prolapse (mvp) isn't known. most people who have the condition are born with it. mvp tends to run in families. also, it's more common in people who are born with connective tissue disorders, such as marfan syndrome. in people who have mvp, the mitral valve may be abnormal in the following ways: the valve flaps may be too large and thick. the valve flaps may be ""floppy."" the tissue of the flaps and their supporting ""strings"" are too stretchy, and parts of the valve flop or bulge back into the atrium. the opening of the valve may stretch. these problems can keep the valve from making a tight seal. some people's valves are abnormal in more than one way."
what is (are) cough ?,"a cough is a natural reflex that protects your lungs. coughing helps clear your airways of lung irritants, such as smoke and mucus (a slimy substance). this helps prevent infections. a cough also can be a symptom of a medical problem. prolonged coughing can cause unpleasant side effects, such as chest pain, exhaustion, light-headedness, and loss of bladder control. coughing also can interfere with sleep, socializing, and work. overview coughing occurs when the nerve endings in your airways become irritated. the airways are tubes that carry air into and out of your lungs. certain substances (such as smoke and pollen), medical conditions, and medicines can irritate these nerve endings. a cough can be acute, subacute, or chronic, depending on how long it lasts. an acute cough lasts less than 3 weeks. common causes of an acute cough are a common cold or other upper respiratory (res-pi-rah-tor-e) infections. examples of other upper respiratory infections include the flu, pneumonia (nu-mo-ne-ah), and whooping cough. a subacute cough lasts 3 to 8 weeks. this type of cough remains even after a cold or other respiratory infection is over. a chronic cough lasts more than 8 weeks. common causes of a chronic cough are upper airway cough syndrome (uacs); asthma; and gastroesophageal (gas-tro-eh-so-fa-je-al) reflux disease, or gerd. ""uacs"" is a term used to describe conditions that inflame the upper airways and cause a cough. examples include sinus infections and allergies. these conditions can cause mucus to run down your throat from the back of your nose. this is called postnasal drip. asthma is a long-term lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. gerd occurs if acid from your stomach backs up into your throat. outlook the best way to treat a cough is to treat its cause. for example, asthma is treated with medicines that open the airways. your doctor may recommend cough medicine if the cause of your cough is unknown and the cough causes a lot of discomfort. cough medicines may harm children. if your child has a cough, talk with his or her doctor about how to treat it."
what are the symptoms of cough ?,"when you cough, mucus (a slimy substance) may come up. coughing helps clear the mucus in your airways from a cold, bronchitis, or other condition. rarely, people cough up blood. if this happens, you should call your doctor right away. a cough may be a symptom of a medical condition. thus, it may occur with other signs and symptoms of that condition. for example, if you have a cold, you may have a runny or stuffy nose. if you have gastroesophageal reflux disease, you may have a sour taste in your mouth. a chronic cough can make you feel tired because you use a lot of energy to cough. it also can prevent you from sleeping well and interfere with work and socializing. a chronic cough also can cause headaches, chest pain, loss of bladder control, sweating, and, rarely, fractured ribs."
how to prevent coronary heart disease risk factors ?,"you can prevent and control many coronary heart disease (chd) risk factors with heart-healthy lifestyle changes and medicines. examples of risk factors you can control include high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and overweight and obesity. only a few risk factorssuch as age, gender, and family historycant be controlled. to reduce your risk of chd and heart attack, try to control each risk factor you can. the good news is that many lifestyle changes help control several chd risk factors at the same time. for example, physical activity may lower your blood pressure, help control diabetes and prediabetes, reduce stress, and help control your weight. heart-healthy lifestyle changes a heart-healthy lifestyle can lower the risk of chd. if you already have chd, a heart-healthy lifestyle may prevent it from getting worse. heart-healthy lifestyle changes include: heart-healthy eating maintaining a healthy weight managing stress physical activity quitting smoking many lifestyle habits begin during childhood. thus, parents and families should encourage their children to make heart-healthy choices, such as following a healthy diet and being physically active. make following a healthy lifestyle a family goal. making lifestyle changes can be hard. but if you make these changes as a family, it may be easier for everyone to prevent or control their chd risk factors. for tips on how to help your children adopt healthy habits, visit we can! ways to enhance childrens activity & nutrition. heart-healthy eating your doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include: fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots whole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas when following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating: a lot of red meat palm and coconut oils sugary foods and beverages two nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise: saturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals trans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats andmeats. saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. when you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. to help you stay on track, here are some examples: 1,200 calories a day 8 grams of saturated fat a day 1,500 calories a day 10 grams of saturated fat a day 1,800 calories a day 12 grams of saturated fat a day 2,000 calories a day 13 grams of saturated fat a day 2,500 calories a day 17 grams of saturated fat a day not all fats are bad. monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are: avocados corn, sunflower, and soybean oils nuts and seeds, such as walnuts olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils peanut butter salmon and trout tofu sodium you should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. this means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. if you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more. dietary approaches to stop hypertension your doctor may recommend the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (dash) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. the dash eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt. the dash eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. read more about dash. alcohol try to limit alcohol intake. too much alcohol canraise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. one drink is: 12 ounces of beer 5 ounces of wine 1 ounces of liquor maintaining a healthy weight maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for coronary heart disease. aim for a healthy weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active. knowing your body mass index (bmi) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. to figure out your bmi, check out nhlbis online bmi calculator or talk to your doctor. a bmi: below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight. between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range. between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight. of 30 or more is considered obese. a general goal to aim for is a bmi of less than 25. your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate bmi goal. measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. if most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. this risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. to learn how to measure your waist, visit assessing your weight and health risk. if youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. a loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower ldl cholesterol, and increase hdl cholesterol. managing stress research shows that the most commonly reported trigger for a heart attack is an emotionally upsetting eventparticularly one involving anger. also, some of the ways people cope with stresssuch as drinking, smoking, or overeatingarent healthy. learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as: a stress management program. meditation physical activity relaxation therapy talking things out with friends or family physical activity routine physical activity can lower many chd risk factors, including ldl (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your hdl cholesterol level. hdl is the good cholesterol that helps prevent chd. everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. the more active you are, the more you will benefit. participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10 minutes at a time spread throughout the week. read more about physical activity at: physical activity and your heart u.s. department of health and human services 2008 physical activity guidelines for americans talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you. quitting smoking if you smoke, quit. smoking can raise your risk for coronary heart disease and heart attack and worsen other coronary heart disease risk factors. talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. if you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. read more about quitting smoking at smoking and your heart. medicines sometimes lifestyle changes arent enough to control your blood cholesterol levels. for example, you may need statin medications to control or lower your cholesterol. by lowering your cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have: coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, or had a prior stroke diabetes high ldl cholesterol levels doctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with those who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke. your doctor also may prescribe other medications to: decrease your chance of having a heart attack or dying suddenly. lower your blood pressure. prevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack or stroke. prevent or delay the need for a procedure or surgery, such as percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting. reduce your hearts workload and relieve chd. take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to.you should still follow a heart-healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your chd."
what is (are) congenital heart defects ?,"congenital (kon-jen-ih-tal) heart defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. these defects can involve: the interior walls of the heart the valves inside the heart the arteries and veins that carry blood to the heart or the body congenital heart defects change the normal flow of blood through the heart. there are many types of congenital heart defects. they range from simple defects with no symptoms to complex defects with severe, life-threatening symptoms. congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect. they affect 8 out of every 1,000 newborns. each year, more than 35,000 babies in the united states are born with congenital heart defects. many of these defects are simple conditions. they need no treatment or are easily fixed. some babies are born with complex congenital heart defects. these defects require special medical care soon after birth. the diagnosis and treatment of complex heart defects has greatly improved over the past few decades. as a result, almost all children who have complex heart defects survive to adulthood and can live active, productive lives. most people who have complex heart defects continue to need special heart care throughout their lives. they may need to pay special attention to how their condition affects issues such as health insurance, employment, birth control and pregnancy, and other health issues. in the united states, more than 1 million adults are living with congenital heart defects."
what are the treatments for congenital heart defects ?,"although many children who have congenital heart defects don't need treatment, some do. doctors repair congenital heart defects with catheter procedures or surgery. sometimes doctors combine catheter and surgical procedures to repair complex heart defects, which may involve several kinds of defects. the treatment your child receives depends on the type and severity of his or her heart defect. other factors include your child's age, size, and general health. some children who have complex congenital heart defects may need several catheter or surgical procedures over a period of years, or they may need to take medicines for years. catheter procedures catheter procedures are much easier on patients than surgery. they involve only a needle puncture in the skin where the catheter (thin, flexible tube) is inserted into a vein or an artery. doctors don't have to surgically open the chest or operate directly on the heart to repair the defect(s). this means that recovery may be easier and quicker. the use of catheter procedures has increased a lot in the past 20 years. they have become the preferred way to repair many simple heart defects, such as atrial septal defect (asd) and pulmonary valve stenosis. for asd repair, the doctor inserts a catheter into a vein in the groin (upper thigh). he or she threads the tube to the heart's septum. a device made up of two small disks or an umbrella-like device is attached to the catheter. when the catheter reaches the septum, the device is pushed out of the catheter. the device is placed so that it plugs the hole between the atria. its secured in place and the catheter is withdrawn from the body. within 6 months, normal tissue grows in and over the device. the closure device does not need to be replaced as the child grows. for pulmonary valve stenosis, the doctor inserts a catheter into a vein and threads it to the hearts pulmonary valve. a tiny balloon at the end of the catheter is quickly inflated to push apart the leaflets, or ""doors,"" of the valve. then, the balloon is deflated and the catheter and ballon are withdrawn. this procedure can be used to repair any narrowed valve in the heart. to help guide the catheter, doctors often use echocardiography (echo), transesophageal (tranz-ih-sof-uh-jee-ul) echo (tee), and coronary angiography (an-jee-og-rah-fee). tee is a special type of echo that takes pictures of the heart through the esophagus. the esophagus is the passage leading from the mouth to the stomach. doctors also use tee to examine complex heart defects. surgery a child may need open-heart surgery if his or her heart defect can't be fixed using a catheter procedure. sometimes one surgery can repair the defect completely. if that's not possible, the child may need more surgeries over months or years to fix the problem. cardiac surgeons may use open-heart surgery to: close holes in the heart with stitches or a patch repair or replace heart valves widen arteries or openings to heart valves repair complex defects, such as problems with the location of blood vessels near the heart or how they are formed rarely, babies are born with multiple defects that are too complex to repair. these babies may need heart transplants. in this procedure, the child's heart is replaced with a healthy heart from a deceased child. the heart has been donated by the deceased childs family."
what causes disseminated intravascular coagulation ?,"some diseases and conditions can disrupt the body's normal blood clotting process and lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic). these diseases and conditions include: sepsis (an infection in the bloodstream) surgery and trauma cancer serious complications of pregnancy and childbirth examples of less common causes of dic are bites from poisonous snakes (such as rattlesnakes and other vipers), frostbite, and burns. the two types of dic are acute and chronic. acute dic begins with clotting in the small blood vessels and quickly leads to serious bleeding. chronic dic causes blood clotting, but it usually doesn't lead to bleeding. cancer is the most common cause of chronic dic. similar clotting conditions two other conditions cause blood clotting in the small blood vessels. however, their causes and treatments differ from those of dic. these conditions are thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (throm-bot-ik throm-bo-cy-toe-pee-nick purr-purr-ah), or ttp, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (hus). hus is more common in children than adults. it's also more likely to cause kidney damage than ttp."
who is at risk for disseminated intravascular coagulation? ?,"disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic) is the result of an underlying disease or condition. people who have one or more of the following conditions are most likely to develop dic: sepsis (an infection in the bloodstream) surgery and trauma cancer serious complications of pregnancy and childbirth people who are bitten by poisonous snakes (such as rattlesnakes and other vipers), or those who have frostbite or burns, also are at risk for dic."
who is at risk for heart attack? ?,"certain risk factors make it more likely that you'll develop coronary heart disease (chd) and have a heart attack. you can control many of these risk factors. risk factors you can control the major risk factors for a heart attack that you can control include: smoking high blood pressure high blood cholesterol overweight and obesity an unhealthy diet (for example, a diet high in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, and sodium) lack of routine physical activity high blood sugar due to insulin resistance or diabetes some of these risk factorssuch as obesity, high blood pressure, and high blood sugartend to occur together. when they do, it's called metabolic syndrome. in general, a person who has metabolic syndrome is twice as likely to develop heart disease and five times as likely to develop diabetes as someone who doesn't have metabolic syndrome. for more information about the risk factors that are part of metabolic syndrome, go to the health topics metabolic syndrome article. risk factors you can't control risk factors that you can't control include: age. the risk of heart disease increases for men after age 45 and for women after age 55 (or after menopause). family history of early heart disease. your risk increases if your father or a brother was diagnosed with heart disease before 55 years of age, or if your mother or a sister was diagnosed with heart disease before 65 years of age. preeclampsia (pre-e-klamp-se-ah). this condition can develop during pregnancy. the two main signs of preeclampsia are a rise in blood pressure and excess protein in the urine. preeclampsia is linked to an increased lifetime risk of heart disease, including chd, heart attack, heart failure, and high blood pressure."
what causes varicose veins ?,"weak or damaged valves in the veins can cause varicose veins. after your arteries and capillaries deliver oxygen-rich blood to your body, your veins return the blood to your heart. the veins in your legs must work against gravity to do this. one-way valves inside the veins open to let blood flow through, and then they shut to keep blood from flowing backward. if the valves are weak or damaged, blood can back up and pool in your veins. this causes the veins to swell. weak vein walls may cause weak valves. normally, the walls of the veins are elastic (stretchy). if these walls become weak, they lose their normal elasticity. they become like an overstretched rubber band. this makes the walls of the veins longer and wider, and it causes the flaps of the valves to separate. when the valve flaps separate, blood can flow backward through the valves. the backflow of blood fills the veins and stretches the walls even more. as a result, the veins get bigger, swell, and often twist as they try to squeeze into their normal space. these are varicose veins. normal vein and varicose vein figure a shows a normal vein with a working valve and normal blood flow. figure b shows a varicose vein with a deformed valve, abnormal blood flow, and thin, stretched walls. the middle image shows where varicose veins might appear in a leg. older age or a family history of varicose veins may raise your risk for weak vein walls. you also may be at higher risk if you have increased pressure in your veins due to overweight or obesity or pregnancy."
who is at risk for varicose veins? ?,"many factors may raise your risk for varicose veins, including family history, older age, gender, pregnancy, overweight or obesity, lack of movement, and leg trauma. family history having family members who have varicose veins may raise your risk for the condition. about half of all people who have varicose veins have a family history of them. older age getting older may raise your risk for varicose veins. the normal wear and tear of aging may cause the valves in your veins to weaken and not work well. gender women tend to get varicose veins more often than men. hormonal changes that occur during puberty, pregnancy, and menopause (or with the use of birth control pills) may raise a woman's risk for varicose veins. pregnancy during pregnancy, the growing fetus puts pressure on the veins in the mother's legs. varicose veins that occur during pregnancy usually get better within 3 to 12 months of delivery. overweight or obesity being overweight or obese can put extra pressure on your veins. this can lead to varicose veins. for more information about overweight and obesity, go to the health topics overweight and obesity article. lack of movement standing or sitting for a long time, especially with your legs bent or crossed, may raise your risk for varicose veins. this is because staying in one position for a long time may force your veins to work harder to pump blood to your heart. leg trauma previous blood clots or traumatic damage to the valves in your veins can weaken their ability to move blood back to the heart, increasing the risk for varicose veins."
what are the treatments for varicose veins ?,"varicose veins are treated with lifestyle changes and medical procedures. the goals of treatment are to relieve symptoms, prevent complications, and improve appearance. if varicose veins cause few symptoms, your doctor may simply suggest making lifestyle changes. if your symptoms are more severe, your doctor may recommend one or more medical procedures. for example, you may need a medical procedure if you have a lot of pain, blood clots, or skin disorders caused by your varicose veins. some people who have varicose veins choose to have procedures to improve how their veins look. although treatment can help existing varicose veins, it can't keep new varicose veins from forming. lifestyle changes lifestyle changes often are the first treatment for varicose veins. these changes can prevent varicose veins from getting worse, reduce pain, and delay other varicose veins from forming. lifestyle changes include the following: avoid standing or sitting for long periods without taking a break. when sitting, avoid crossing your legs. keep your legs raised when sitting, resting, or sleeping. when you can, raise your legs above the level of your heart. do physical activities to get your legs moving and improve muscle tone. this helps blood move through your veins. if you're overweight or obese, try to lose weight. this will improve blood flow and ease the pressure on your veins. avoid wearing tight clothes, especially those that are tight around your waist, groin (upper thighs), and legs. tight clothes can make varicose veins worse. avoid wearing high heels for long periods. lower heeled shoes can help tone your calf muscles. toned muscles help blood move through the veins. your doctor may recommend compression stockings. these stockings create gentle pressure up the leg. this pressure keeps blood from pooling and decreases swelling in the legs. there are three types of compression stockings. one type is support pantyhose. these offer the least amount of pressure. a second type is over-the-counter compression hose. these stockings give a little more pressure than support pantyhose. over-the-counter compression hose are sold in medical supply stores and pharmacies. prescription-strength compression hose are the third type of compression stockings. these stockings offer the greatest amount of pressure. they also are sold in medical supply stores and pharmacies. however, you need to be fitted for them in the store by a specially trained person. medical procedures medical procedures are done either to remove varicose veins or to close them. removing or closing varicose veins usually doesn't cause problems with blood flow because the blood starts moving through other veins. you may be treated with one or more of the procedures described below. common side effects right after most of these procedures include bruising, swelling, skin discoloration, and slight pain. the side effects are most severe with vein stripping and ligation (li-ga-shun). rarely, this procedure can cause severe pain, infections, blood clots, and scarring. sclerotherapy sclerotherapy (skler-o-ther-ah-pe) uses a liquid chemical to close off a varicose vein. the chemical is injected into the vein to cause irritation and scarring inside the vein. the irritation and scarring cause the vein to close off, and it fades away. this procedure often is used to treat smaller varicose veins and spider veins. it can be done in your doctor's office, while you stand. you may need several treatments to completely close off a vein. treatments typically are done every 4 to 6 weeks. following treatments, your legs will be wrapped in elastic bandaging to help with healing and decrease swelling. microsclerotherapy microsclerotherapy (mi-kro-skler-o-ther-ah-pe) is used to treat spider veins and other very small varicose veins. a small amount of liquid chemical is injected into a vein using a very fine needle. the chemical scars the inner lining of the vein, causing it to close off. laser surgery this procedure applies light energy from a laser onto a varicose vein. the laser light makes the vein fade away. laser surgery mostly is used to treat smaller varicose veins. no cutting or injection of chemicals is involved. endovenous ablation therapy endovenous ablation (ab-la-shun) therapy uses lasers or radiowaves to create heat to close off a varicose vein. your doctor makes a tiny cut in your skin near the varicose vein. he or she then inserts a small tube called a catheter into the vein. a device at the tip of the tube heats up the inside of the vein and closes it off. you'll be awake during this procedure, but your doctor will numb the area around the vein. you usually can go home the same day as the procedure. endoscopic vein surgery for endoscopic (en-do-skop-ik) vein surgery, your doctor will make a small cut in your skin near a varicose vein. he or she then uses a tiny camera at the end of a thin tube to move through the vein. a surgical device at the end of the camera is used to close the vein. endoscopic vein surgery usually is used only in severe cases when varicose veins are causing skin ulcers (sores). after the procedure, you usually can return to your normal activities within a few weeks. ambulatory phlebectomy for ambulatory phlebectomy (fle-bek-to-me), your doctor will make small cuts in your skin to remove small varicose veins. this procedure usually is done to remove the varicose veins closest to the surface of your skin. you'll be awake during the procedure, but your doctor will numb the area around the vein. usually, you can go home the same day that the procedure is done. vein stripping and ligation vein stripping and ligation typically is done only for severe cases of varicose veins. the procedure involves tying shut and removing the veins through small cuts in your skin. you'll be given medicine to temporarily put you to sleep so you don't feel any pain during the procedure. vein stripping and ligation usually is done as an outpatient procedure. the recovery time from the procedure is about 1 to 4 weeks."
what is (are) narcolepsy ?,"narcolepsy (nar-ko-lep-se) is a disorder that causes periods of extreme daytime sleepiness. the disorder also may cause muscle weakness. most people who have narcolepsy have trouble sleeping at night. some people who have the disorder fall asleep suddenly, even if they're in the middle of talking, eating, or another activity. narcolepsy also can cause: cataplexy (kat-ah-plek-se). this condition causes a sudden loss of muscle tone while you're awake. muscle weakness can affect certain parts of your body or your whole body. for example, if cataplexy affects your hand, you may drop what you're holding. strong emotions often trigger this weakness. it may last seconds or minutes. hallucinations (ha-lu-sih-na-shuns). these vivid dreams occur while falling asleep or waking up. sleep paralysis (pah-ral-ih-sis). this condition prevents you from moving or speaking while waking up and sometimes while falling asleep. sleep paralysis usually goes away within a few minutes. overview the two main phases of sleep are nonrapid eye movement (nrem) and rapid eye movement (rem). most people are in the nrem phase when they first fall asleep. after about 90 minutes of sleep, most people go from nrem to rem sleep. dreaming occurs during the rem phase of sleep. during rem, your muscles normally become limp. this prevents you from acting out your dreams. (for more information about sleep cycles, go to the national heart, lung, and blood institute's ""your guide to healthy sleep."") people who have narcolepsy often fall into rem sleep quickly and wake up directly from it. as a result, they may have vivid dreams while falling asleep and waking up. hypocretin (hi-po-kreet-in), a chemical in the brain, helps promote wakefulness. most people who have narcolepsy have low levels of this chemical. what causes these low levels isn't well understood. researchers think that certain factors may work together to cause a lack of hypocretin. these factors may include heredity, infections, brain injuries, and autoimmune disorders. (autoimmune disorders occur if the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the body's cells and tissues.) outlook narcolepsy symptoms usually begin during the teen or young adult years. people who have narcolepsy may find it hard to function at school, work, home, and in social situations because of extreme tiredness. narcolepsy has no cure, but medicines, lifestyle changes, and other therapies can improve symptoms. research is ongoing on the causes of narcolepsy and new ways to treat it."
who is at risk for bronchitis? ?,"bronchitis is a very common condition. millions of cases occur every year. elderly people, infants, and young children are at higher risk for acute bronchitis than people in other age groups. people of all ages can develop chronic bronchitis, but it occurs more often in people who are older than 45. also, many adults who develop chronic bronchitis are smokers. women are more than twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with chronic bronchitis. smoking and having an existing lung disease greatly increase your risk for bronchitis. contact with dust, chemical fumes, and vapors from certain jobs also increases your risk for the condition. examples include jobs in coal mining, textile manufacturing, grain handling, and livestock farming. air pollution, infections, and allergies can worsen the symptoms of chronic bronchitis, especially if you smoke."
what are the treatments for bronchitis ?,"the main goals of treating acute and chronic bronchitis are to relieve symptoms and make breathing easier. if you have acute bronchitis, your doctor may recommend rest, plenty of fluids, and aspirin (for adults) or acetaminophen to treat fever. antibiotics usually aren't prescribed for acute bronchitis. this is because they don't work against virusesthe most common cause of acute bronchitis. however, if your doctor thinks you have a bacterial infection, he or she may prescribe antibiotics. a humidifier or steam can help loosen mucus and relieve wheezing and limited air flow. if your bronchitis causes wheezing, you may need an inhaled medicine to open your airways. you take this medicine using an inhaler. this device allows the medicine to go straight to your lungs. your doctor also may prescribe medicines to relieve or reduce your cough and treat your inflamed airways (especially if your cough persists). if you have chronic bronchitis and also have been diagnosed with copd (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), you may need medicines to open your airways and help clear away mucus. these medicines include bronchodilators (inhaled) and steroids (inhaled or pill form). if you have chronic bronchitis, your doctor may prescribe oxygen therapy. this treatment can help you breathe easier, and it provides your body with needed oxygen. one of the best ways to treat acute and chronic bronchitis is to remove the source of irritation and damage to your lungs. if you smoke, it's very important to quit. talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. try to avoid secondhand smoke and other lung irritants, such as dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. for more information about how to quit smoking, go to the diseases and conditions index smoking and your heart article and the national heart, lung, and blood institute's ""your guide to a healthy heart."" although these resources focus on heart health, they include general information about how to quit smoking."
who is at risk for broken heart syndrome? ?,"broken heart syndrome affects women more often than men. often, people who experience broken heart syndrome have previously been healthy. research shows that the traditional risk factors for heart disease may not apply to broken heart syndrome. people who might be at increased risk for broken heart syndrome include: women who have gone through menopause, particularly women in their sixties and seventies people who often have no previous history of heart disease asian and white populations although these are the characteristics for most cases of broken heart syndrome, the condition can occur in anyone. research is ongoing to learn more about broken heart syndrome and its causes."
how to prevent bronchiectasis ?,"to prevent bronchiectasis, it's important to prevent the lung infections and lung damage that can cause it. childhood vaccines for measles and whooping cough prevent infections related to these illnesses. these vaccines also reduce complications from these infections, such as bronchiectasis. avoiding toxic fumes, gases, smoke, and other harmful substances also can help protect your lungs. proper treatment of lung infections in children also may help preserve lung function and prevent lung damage that can lead to bronchiectasis. stay alert to keep children (and adults) from inhaling small objects (such as pieces of toys and food that might stick in a small airway). if you think you, your child, or someone else has inhaled a small object, seek prompt medical care. in some cases, treating the underlying cause of bronchiectasis can slow or prevent its progression."
what causes pulmonary hypertension ?,"pulmonary hypertension (ph) begins with inflammation and changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. other factors also can affect the pulmonary arteries and cause ph. for example, the condition may develop if: the walls of the arteries tighten. the walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells. blood clots form in the arteries. these changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. thus, the pressure in the arteries rises, causing ph. many factors can contribute to the process that leads to the different types of ph. group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) may have no known cause, or the condition may be inherited. (""inherited"" means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes.) some diseases and conditions also can cause group 1 pah. examples include hiv infection, congenital heart disease, and sickle cell disease. also, the use of street drugs (such as cocaine) and certain diet medicines can lead to pah. many diseases and conditions can cause groups 2 through 5 ph (often called secondary ph), including: mitral valve disease lung diseases, such as copd (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) sleep apnea sarcoidosis for more information about the types of ph and the diseases, conditions, and factors that can cause them, go to ""types of pulmonary hypertension."""
who is at risk for pulmonary hypertension? ?,"the exact number of people who have pulmonary hypertension (ph) isn't known. group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) without a known cause is rare. it affects women more often than men. people who have group 1 pah tend to be overweight. ph that occurs with another disease or condition is more common. ph usually develops between the ages of 20 and 60, but it can occur at any age. people who are at increased risk for ph include: those who have a family history of the condition. those who have certain diseases or conditions, such as heart and lung diseases, liver disease, hiv infection, or blood clots in the pulmonary arteries. (for more information about the diseases, conditions, and factors that cause ph, go to ""types of pulmonary hypertension."") those who use street drugs (such as cocaine) or certain diet medicines. those who live at high altitudes."
what are the treatments for pulmonary hypertension ?,"pulmonary hypertension (ph) has no cure. however, treatment may help relieve symptoms and slow the progress of the disease. ph is treated with medicines, procedures, and other therapies. treatment will depend on what type of ph you have and its severity. (for more information, go to ""types of pulmonary hypertension."") group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) includes ph that's inherited, that has no known cause, or that's caused by certain drugs or conditions. treatments for group 1 pah include medicines and medical procedures. medicines your doctor may prescribe medicines to relax the blood vessels in your lungs and reduce excess cell growth in the blood vessels. as the blood vessels relax, more blood can flow through them. your doctor may prescribe medicines that are taken by mouth, inhaled, or injected. examples of medicines for group 1 pah include: phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil prostanoids, such as epoprostenol endothelin receptor antagonists, such as bosentan and ambrisentan calcium channel blockers, such as diltiazem your doctor may prescribe one or more of these medicines. to find out which of these medicines works best, you'll likely have an acute vasoreactivity test. this test shows how the pressure in your pulmonary arteries reacts to certain medicines. the test is done during right heart catheterization. medical and surgical procedures if you have group 1 pah, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following procedures. atrial septostomy (sep-tos-toe-me). for this procedure, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your leg and threaded to your heart. the tube is then put through the wall that separates your right and left atria (the upper chambers of your heart). this wall is called the septum. a tiny balloon on the tip of the tube is inflated. this creates an opening between the atria. this procedure relieves the pressure in the right atria and increases blood flow. atrial septostomy is rarely done in the united states. lung transplant. a lung transplant is surgery to replace a person's diseased lung with a healthy lung from a deceased donor. this procedure may be used for people who have severe lung disease that's causing pah. heartlung transplant. a heartlung transplant is surgery in which both the heart and lung are replaced with healthy organs from a deceased donor. group 2 pulmonary hypertension conditions that affect the left side of the heart, such as mitral valve disease, can cause group 2 ph. treating the underlying condition will help treat ph. treatments may include lifestyle changes, medicines, and surgery. group 3 pulmonary hypertension lung diseases, such as copd (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and interstitial lung disease, can cause group 3 ph. certain sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, also can cause group 3 ph. if you have this type of ph, you may need oxygen therapy. this treatment raises the level of oxygen in your blood. you'll likely get the oxygen through soft, plastic prongs that fit into your nose. oxygen therapy can be done at home or in a hospital. your doctor also may recommend other treatments if you have an underlying lung disease. group 4 pulmonary hypertension blood clots in the lungs or blood clotting disorders can cause group 4 ph. if you have this type of ph, your doctor will likely prescribe blood-thinning medicines. these medicines prevent clots from forming or getting larger. sometimes doctors use surgery to remove scarring in the pulmonary arteries due to old blood clots. group 5 pulmonary hypertension various diseases and conditions, such as thyroid disease and sarcoidosis, can cause group 5 ph. an object, such as a tumor, pressing on the pulmonary arteries also can cause group 5 ph. group 5 ph is treated by treating its cause. all types of pulmonary hypertension several treatments may be used for all types of ph. these treatments include: diuretics, also called water pills. these medicines help reduce fluid buildup in your body, including swelling in your ankles and feet. blood-thinning medicines. these medicines help prevent blood clots from forming or getting larger. digoxin. this medicine helps the heart beat stronger and pump more blood. digoxin sometimes is used to control the heart rate if abnormal heart rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, occur. oxygen therapy. this treatment raises the level of oxygen in your blood. physical activity. regular activity may help improve your ability to be active. talk with your doctor about a physical activity plan that's safe for you. research is ongoing for better ph treatments. these treatments offer hope for the future."
how to prevent thrombocytopenia ?,"whether you can prevent thrombocytopenia depends on its specific cause. usually the condition can't be prevented. however, you can take steps to prevent health problems associated with thrombocytopenia. for example: avoid heavy drinking. alcohol slows the production of platelets. try to avoid contact with toxic chemicals. chemicals such as pesticides, arsenic, and benzene can slow the production of platelets. avoid medicines that you know have decreased your platelet count in the past. be aware of medicines that may affect your platelets and raise your risk of bleeding. two examples of such medicines are aspirin and ibuprofen. these medicines may thin your blood too much. talk with your doctor about getting vaccinated for viruses that can affect your platelets. you may need vaccines for mumps, measles, rubella, and chickenpox. you may want to have your child vaccinated for these viruses as well. talk with your child's doctor about these vaccines."
what causes angina ?,"underlying causes angina usually is a symptom of coronary heart disease (chd). this means that the underlying causes of angina generally are the same as the underlying causes of chd. research suggests that chd starts when certain factors damage the inner layers of the coronary arteries. these factors include: smoking high amounts of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood high blood pressure high amounts of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes plaque may begin to build up where the arteries are damaged. when plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis (ath-er-o-skler-o-sis). plaque narrows or blocks the arteries, reducing blood flow to the heart muscle. some plaque is hard and stable and causes the arteries to become narrow and stiff. this can greatly reduce blood flow to the heart and cause angina. other plaque is soft and more likely to rupture (break open) and cause blood clots. blood clots can partially or totally block the coronary arteries and cause angina or a heart attack. immediate causes many factors can trigger angina pain, depending on the type of angina you have. stable angina physical exertion is the most common trigger of stable angina. severely narrowed arteries may allow enough blood to reach the heart when the demand for oxygen is low, such as when you're sitting. however, with physical exertionlike walking up a hill or climbing stairsthe heart works harder and needs more oxygen. other triggers of stable angina include: emotional stress exposure to very hot or cold temperatures heavy meals smoking unstable angina blood clots that partially or totally block an artery cause unstable angina. if plaque in an artery ruptures, blood clots may form. this creates a blockage. a clot may grow large enough to completely block the artery and cause a heart attack. for more information, go to the animation in ""what causes a heart attack?"" blood clots may form, partially dissolve, and later form again. angina can occur each time a clot blocks an artery. variant angina a spasm in a coronary artery causes variant angina. the spasm causes the walls of the artery to tighten and narrow. blood flow to the heart slows or stops. variant angina can occur in people who have chd and in those who dont. the coronary arteries can spasm as a result of: exposure to cold emotional stress medicines that tighten or narrow blood vessels smoking cocaine use microvascular angina this type of angina may be a symptom of coronary microvascular disease (mvd). coronary mvd is heart disease that affects the hearts smallest coronary arteries. reduced blood flow in the small coronary arteries may cause microvascular angina. plaque in the arteries, artery spasms, or damaged or diseased artery walls can reduce blood flow through the small coronary arteries."
what are the symptoms of angina ?,"pain and discomfort are the main symptoms of angina. angina often is described as pressure, squeezing, burning, or tightness in the chest. the pain or discomfort usually starts behind the breastbone. pain from angina also can occur in the arms, shoulders, neck, jaw, throat, or back. the pain may feel like indigestion. some people say that angina pain is hard to describe or that they can't tell exactly where the pain is coming from. signs and symptoms such as nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), fatigue (tiredness), shortness of breath, sweating, light-headedness, and weakness also may occur. women are more likely to feel discomfort in the neck, jaw, throat, abdomen, or back. shortness of breath is more common in older people and those who have diabetes. weakness, dizziness, and confusion can mask the signs and symptoms of angina in elderly people. symptoms also vary based on the type of angina you have. because angina has so many possible symptoms and causes, all chest pain should be checked by a doctor. chest pain that lasts longer than a few minutes and isn't relieved by rest or angina medicine may be a sign of a heart attack. call 911 right away. stable angina the pain or discomfort: occurs when the heart must work harder, usually during physical exertion doesn't come as a surprise, and episodes of pain tend to be alike usually lasts a short time (5 minutes or less) is relieved by rest or medicine may feel like gas or indigestion may feel like chest pain that spreads to the arms, back, or other areas unstable angina the pain or discomfort: often occurs at rest, while sleeping at night, or with little physical exertion comes as a surprise is more severe and lasts longer than stable angina (as long as 30 minutes) usually isnt relieved by rest or medicine may get worse over time may mean that a heart attack will happen soon variant angina the pain or discomfort: usually occurs at rest and during the night or early morning hours tends to be severe is relieved by medicine microvascular angina the pain or discomfort: may be more severe and last longer than other types of angina pain may occur with shortness of breath, sleep problems, fatigue, and lack of energy often is first noticed during routine daily activities and times of mental stress"
what are the treatments for heart failure ?,"early diagnosis and treatment can help people who have heart failure live longer, more active lives. treatment for heart failure depends on the type and severity of the heart failure. the goals of treatment for all stages of heart failure include: treating the conditions underlying cause, such ascoronary heart disease,high blood pressure, ordiabetes reducing symptoms stopping the heart failure from getting worse increasing your lifespan and improving your quality of life treatments usually include lifestyle changes, medicines, and ongoing care. if you have severe heart failure, you also may need medical procedures or surgery. heart-healthy lifestyle changes your doctor may recommend heart-healthy lifestyle changes if you have heart failure. heart-healthy lifestyle changes include: heart-healthy eating maintaining a healthy weight physical activity quitting smoking heart-healthy eating your doctor may recommend a heart-healthy eating plan, which should include: fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots whole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas when following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating: a lot of red meat palm and coconut oils sugary foods and beverages two nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise: saturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals trans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats andmeats. saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. when you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. to help you stay on track, here are some examples: if you eat: try to eat no more than: 1,200 calories a day 8 grams of saturated fat a day 1,500 calories a day 10 grams of saturated fat a day 1,800 calories a day 12 grams of saturated fat a day 2,000 calories a day 13 grams of saturated fat a day 2,500 calories a day 17 grams of saturated fat a day not all fats are bad. monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterollevels. some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are: avocados corn, sunflower, and soybean oils nuts and seeds, such as walnuts olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils peanut butter salmon and trout tofu sodium you should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. this means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. if you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more. dietary approaches to stop hypertension your doctor may recommend the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (dash) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. the dash eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt. the dash eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. read more about dash. liquid intake its important for people who have heart failure to take in the correct amounts and types of liquids. consuming too much liquid can worsen heart failure. also, if you have heart failure, you shouldnt drink alcohol. talk with your doctor about what amounts and types of liquids you should have each day. maintaining a healthy weight maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for heart failure and coronary heart disease. aim for a healthy weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active. knowing your body mass index (bmi) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. to figure out your bmi, check out the national heart, lung, and blood institutes (nhlbi) online bmi calculator or talk to your doctor. a bmi: below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight. between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range. between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight. of 30 or more is considered obese. a general goal to aim for is a bmi below 25. your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate bmi goal. measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. if most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. this risk may be higher with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. to learn how to measure your waist, visit assessing your weight and health risk. if youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. a loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower ldl cholesterol, and increase hdl cholesterol. physical activity routine physical activity can lower many coronary heart disease risk factors, including ldl (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your hdl cholesterol level. hdl is the good cholesterol that helps prevent coronary heart disease. everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. the more active you are, the more you will benefit. participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week. read more about physical activity at: physical activity and your heart u.s. department of health and human services 2008 physical activity guidelines foramericans talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you. quitting smoking if you smoke, quit. smoking can raise your risk for coronary heart disease and heart attack and worsen heart failure. talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. if you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. read more about quitting smoking at smoking and your heart. medicines your doctor will prescribe medicines based on the type of heart failure you have, how severe it is, and your response to certain medicines. the following medicines are commonly used to treat heart failure: ace inhibitors lower blood pressure and reduce strain on your heart. they also may reduce the risk of a futureheart attack. aldosterone antagonists trigger the body to remove excess sodium through urine. this lowers the volume of blood that the heart must pump. angiotensin receptor blockers relax your blood vessels and lower blood pressure to decrease your hearts workload. beta blockers slow your heart rate and lower your blood pressure to decrease your hearts workload. digoxin makes the heart beat stronger and pump more blood. diuretics (fluid pills) help reduce fluid buildup in your lungs and swelling in your feet and ankles. isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine hydrochloride helps relax your blood vessels so your heart doesnt work as hard to pump blood. studies have shown that this medicine can reduce the risk of death in blacks. more studies are needed to find out whether this medicine will benefit other racial groups. take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. you should still follow a heart healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your heart failure. ongoing care you should watch for signs that heart failure is getting worse. for example, weight gain may mean that fluids are building up in your body. ask your doctor how often you should check your weight and when to report weight changes. getting medical care for other related conditions is important. if you have diabetes or high blood pressure, work with your health care team to control these conditions. have your blood sugar level and blood pressure checked. talk with your doctor about when you should have tests and how often to take measurements at home. try to avoid respiratory infections like the flu andpneumonia. talk with your doctor or nurse about getting flu and pneumonia vaccines. many people who have severe heart failure may need treatment in a hospital from time to time. your doctor may recommend oxygen therapy, which can be given in a hospital or at home. medical procedures and surgery as heart failure worsens, lifestyle changes and medicines may no longer control your symptoms. you may need a medical procedure or surgery. in heart failure, the right and left sides of the heart may no longer contract at the same time. this disrupts the hearts pumping. to correct this problem, your doctor might implant a cardiac resynchronization therapy device (a type ofpacemaker) near your heart. this device helps both sides of your heart contract at the same time, which can decrease heart failure symptoms. some people who have heart failure have very rapid, irregular heartbeats. without treatment, these heartbeats can causesudden cardiac arrest. your doctor might implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (icd) near your heart to solve this problem. an icd checks your heart rate and uses electrical pulses to correct irregular heart rhythms. people who have severe heart failure symptoms at rest, despite other treatments, may need: a mechanical heart pump, such as aleft ventricular assist device. this device helps pump blood from the heart to the rest of the body. you may use a heart pump until you have surgery or as a long-term treatment. heart transplant. a heart transplant is an operation in which a persons diseased heart is replaced with a healthy heart from a deceased donor. heart transplants are done as a life-saving measure for end-stage heart failure when medical treatment and less drastic surgery have failed."
how to diagnose thrombocythemia and thrombocytosis ?,"your doctor will diagnose thrombocythemia or thrombocytosis based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. a hematologist also may be involved in your care. this is a doctor who specializes in blood diseases and conditions. medical history your doctor may ask you about factors that can affect your platelets, such as: any medical procedures or blood transfusions you've had any recent infections or vaccines you've had the medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines your general eating habits, including the amount of alcohol you normally drink any family history of high platelet counts physical exam your doctor will do a physical exam to look for signs and symptoms of blood clots and bleeding. he or she also will check for signs of conditions that can cause secondary thrombocytosis, such as an infection. primary thrombocythemia is diagnosed only after all possible causes of a high platelet count are ruled out. for example, your doctor may recommend tests to check for early, undiagnosed cancer. if another disease, condition, or factor is causing a high platelet count, the diagnosis is secondary thrombocytosis. diagnostic tests your doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests to help diagnose a high platelet count. complete blood count a complete blood count (cbc) measures the levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. for this test, a small amount of blood is drawn from a blood vessel, usually in your arm. if you have thrombocythemia or thrombocytosis, the cbc results will show that your platelet count is high. blood smear a blood smear is used to check the condition of your platelets. for this test, a small amount of blood is drawn from a blood vessel, usually in your arm. some of your blood is put on a glass slide. a microscope is then used to look at your platelets. bone marrow tests bone marrow tests check whether your bone marrow is healthy. blood cells, including platelets, are made in the bone marrow. the two bone marrow tests are aspiration (as-pih-ra-shun) and biopsy. bone marrow aspiration might be done to find out whether your bone marrow is making too many platelets. for this test, your doctor removes a sample of fluid bone marrow through a needle. he or she examines the sample under a microscope to check for faulty cells. a bone marrow biopsy often is done right after an aspiration. for this test, your doctor removes a small amount of bone marrow tissue through a needle. he or she examines the tissue to check the number and types of cells in the bone marrow. with thrombocythemia and thrombocytosis, the bone marrow has a higher than normal number of the very large cells that make platelets. other tests your doctor may recommend other blood tests to look for genetic factors that can cause a high platelet count."
what are the symptoms of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ?,"blood clots, a low platelet count, and damaged red blood cells cause the signs and symptoms of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (ttp). the signs and symptoms include: purplish bruises on the skin or mucous membranes (such as in the mouth). these bruises, called purpura, are caused by bleeding under the skin. pinpoint-sized red or purple dots on the skin. these dots, called petechiae, often are found in groups and may look like a rash. bleeding under the skin causes petechiae. paleness or jaundice (a yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes). fatigue (feeling very tired and weak). fever. a fast heart rate or shortness of breath. headache, speech changes, confusion, coma, stroke, or seizure. a low amount of urine, or protein or blood in the urine. if you've had ttp and have any of these signs or symptoms, you may be having a relapse (flareup). ask your doctor when to call him or her or seek emergency care."
how to diagnose alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency ?,"alpha-1 antitrypsin (aat) deficiency usually is diagnosed after you develop a lung or liver disease that's related to the condition. your doctor may suspect aat deficiency if you have signs or symptoms of a serious lung condition, especially emphysema, without any obvious cause. he or she also may suspect aat deficiency if you develop emphysema when you're 45 years old or younger. specialists involved many doctors may be involved in the diagnosis of aat deficiency. these include primary care doctors, pulmonologists (lung specialists), and hepatologists (liver specialists). to diagnose aat deficiency, your doctor will: ask about possible risk factors. risk factors include smoking and exposure to dust, fumes, and other toxic substances. ask about your medical history. a common sign of aat deficiency is if you have a lung or liver disease without any obvious causes or risk factors. another sign is if you have emphysema at an unusually early age (45 years or younger). ask about your family's medical history. if you have bloodline relatives who have aat deficiency, you're more likely to have the condition. diagnostic tests your doctor may recommend tests to confirm a diagnosis of aat deficiency. he or she also may recommend tests to check for lung- or liver-related conditions. a genetic test is the most certain way to check for aat deficiency. this test will show whether you have faulty aat genes. a blood test also may be used. this test checks the level of aat protein in your blood. if the level is a lot lower than normal, it's likely that you have aat deficiency. lung-related tests if you have a lung disease related to aat deficiency, your doctor may recommend lung function tests and high-resolution computed tomography (to-mog-rah-fee) scanning, also called ct scanning. lung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. these tests may show how severe your lung disease is and how well treatment is working. high-resolution ct scanning uses x rays to create detailed pictures of parts of the body. a ct scan can show whether you have emphysema or another lung disease and how severe it is."
how to prevent alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency ?,"you can't prevent alpha-1 antitrypsin (aat) deficiency because the condition is inherited (passed from parents to children through genes). if you inherit two faulty aat genes, you'll have aat deficiency. even so, you may never develop one of the diseases related to the condition. you can take steps to prevent or delay lung diseases related to aat deficiency. one important step is to quit smoking. if you don't smoke, don't start. talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. if you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. for more information about how to quit smoking, go to the health topics smoking and your heart article and the national heart, lung, and blood institute's ""your guide to a healthy heart."" although these resources focus on heart health, they include basic information about how to quit smoking. also, try to avoid secondhand smoke and places with dust, fumes, or other toxic substances that you may inhale. check your living and working spaces for things that may irritate your lungs. examples include flower and tree pollen, ash, allergens, air pollution, wood burning stoves, paint fumes, and fumes from cleaning products and other household items. if you have a lung disease related to aat deficiency, ask your doctor whether you might benefit from augmentation therapy. this is a treatment in which you receive infusions of aat protein. augmentation therapy raises the level of aat protein in your blood and lungs. (for more information, go to ""how is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency treated?"")"
what causes pulmonary embolism ?,"major causes pulmonary embolism (pe) usually begins as a blood clot in a deep vein of the leg. this condition is called deep vein thrombosis. the clot can break free, travel through the bloodstream to the lungs, and block an artery. the animation below shows how a blood clot from a deep vein in the leg can travel to the lungs, causing pulmonary embolism. click the ""start"" button to play the animation. written and spoken explanations are provided with each frame. use the buttons in the lower right corner to pause, restart, or replay the animation, or use the scroll bar below the buttons to move through the frames. blood clots can form in the deep veins of the legs if blood flow is restricted and slows down. this can happen if you don't move around for long periods, such as: after some types of surgery during a long trip in a car or airplane if you must stay in bed for an extended time blood clots are more likely to develop in veins damaged from surgery or injured in other ways. other causes rarely, an air bubble, part of a tumor, or other tissue travels to the lungs and causes pe. also, if a large bone in the body (such as the thigh bone) breaks, fat from the bone marrow can travel through the blood. if the fat reaches the lungs, it can cause pe"
how to diagnose pulmonary embolism ?,"pulmonary embolism (pe) is diagnosed based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. doctors who treat patients in the emergency room often are the ones to diagnose pe with the help of a radiologist. a radiologist is a doctor who deals with x rays and other similar tests. medical history and physical exam to diagnose pe, the doctor will ask about your medical history. he or she will want to: find out your deep vein thrombosis (dvt) and pe risk factors see how likely it is that you could have pe rule out other possible causes for your symptoms your doctor also will do a physical exam. during the exam, he or she will check your legs for signs of dvt. he or she also will check your blood pressure and your heart and lungs. diagnostic tests many tests can help diagnose pe. which tests you have will depend on how you feel when you get to the hospital, your risk factors, available testing options, and other conditions you could possibly have. you may have one or more of the following tests. ultrasound doctors can use ultrasound to look for blood clots in your legs. ultrasound uses sound waves to check blood flow in your veins. for this test, gel is put on the skin of your legs. a hand-held device called a transducer is moved back and forth over the affected areas. the transducer gives off ultrasound waves and detects their echoes as they bounce off the vein walls and blood cells. a computer turns the echoes into a picture on a computer screen, allowing the doctor to see blood flow in your legs. if the doctor finds blood clots in the deep veins of your legs, he or she will recommend treatment. dvt and pe both are treated with the same medicines. computed tomography scans doctors can use computed tomography (to-mog-rah-fee) scans, or ct scans, to look for blood clots in the lungs and legs. for this test, dye is injected into a vein in your arm. the dye makes the blood vessels in your lungs and legs show up on x-ray images. you'll lie on a table, and an x-ray tube will rotate around you. the tube will take pictures from many angles. this test allows doctors to detect most cases of pe. the test only takes a few minutes. results are available shortly after the scan is done. lung ventilation/perfusion scan a lung ventilation/perfusion scan, or vq scan, uses a radioactive substance to show how well oxygen and blood are flowing to all areas of your lungs. this test can help detect pe. pulmonary angiography pulmonary angiography (an-jee-og-rah-fee) is another test used to diagnose pe. this test isn't available at all hospitals, and a trained specialist must do the test. for this test, a flexible tube called a catheter is threaded through the groin (upper thigh) or arm to the blood vessels in the lungs. dye is injected into the blood vessels through the catheter. x-ray pictures are taken to show blood flowing through the blood vessels in the lungs. if a blood clot is found, your doctor may use the catheter to remove it or deliver medicine to dissolve it. blood tests certain blood tests may help your doctor find out whether you're likely to have pe. a d-dimer test measures a substance in the blood that's released when a blood clot breaks down. high levels of the substance may mean a clot is present. if your test is normal and you have few risk factors, pe isn't likely. other blood tests check for inherited disorders that cause blood clots. blood tests also can measure the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood. a clot in a blood vessel in your lungs may lower the level of oxygen in your blood. other tests to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms, your doctor may use one or more of the following tests. echocardiography (echo). this test uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. doctors use echo to check heart function and detect blood clots inside the heart. ekg (electrocardiogram). an ekg is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. chest x ray. this test creates pictures of your lungs, heart, large arteries, ribs, and diaphragm (the muscle below your lungs). chest mri (magnetic resonance imaging). this test uses radio waves and magnetic fields to create pictures of organs and structures inside the body. mri often can provide more information than an x ray."
how to prevent pulmonary embolism ?,"preventing pulmonary embolism (pe) begins with preventing deep vein thrombosis (dvt). knowing whether you're at risk for dvt and taking steps to lower your risk are important. exercise your lower leg muscles if you're sitting for a long time while traveling. get out of bed and move around as soon as you're able after having surgery or being ill. the sooner you move around, the better your chance is of avoiding a blood clot. take medicines to prevent clots after some types of surgery (as your doctor prescribes). follow up with your doctor. if you've already had dvt or pe, you can take more steps to prevent new blood clots from forming. visit your doctor for regular checkups. also, use compression stockings to prevent chronic (ongoing) swelling in your legs from dvt (as your doctor advises). contact your doctor right away if you have any signs or symptoms of dvt or pe."
what causes respiratory failure ?,"diseases and conditions that impair breathing can cause respiratory failure. these disorders may affect the muscles, nerves, bones, or tissues that support breathing, or they may affect the lungs directly. when breathing is impaired, your lungs can't easily move oxygen into your blood and remove carbon dioxide from your blood (gas exchange). this can cause a low oxygen level or high carbon dioxide level, or both, in your blood. respiratory failure can occur as a result of: conditions that affect the nerves and muscles that control breathing. examples include muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als), spinal cord injuries, and stroke. damage to the tissues and ribs around the lungs. an injury to the chest can cause this damage. problems with the spine, such as scoliosis (a curve in the spine). this condition can affect the bones and muscles used for breathing. drug or alcohol overdose. an overdose affects the area of the brain that controls breathing. during an overdose, breathing becomes slow and shallow. lung diseases and conditions, such as copd (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), pneumonia, ards (acute respiratory distress syndrome), pulmonary embolism, and cystic fibrosis. these diseases and conditions can affect the flow of air and blood into and out of your lungs. ards and pneumonia affect gas exchange in the air sacs. acute lung injuries. for example, inhaling harmful fumes or smoke can injure your lungs. normal lungs and conditions causing respiratory failure"
what are the treatments for respiratory failure ?,"treatment for respiratory failure depends on whether the condition is acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing) and its severity. treatment also depends on the condition's underlying cause. acute respiratory failure can be a medical emergency. it often is treated in an intensive care unit at a hospital. chronic respiratory failure often can be treated at home. if chronic respiratory failure is severe, your doctor may recommend treatment in a long-term care center. one of the main goals of treating respiratory failure is to get oxygen to your lungs and other organs and remove carbon dioxide from your body. another goal is to treat the underlying cause of the condition. oxygen therapy and ventilator support if you have respiratory failure, you may receive oxygen therapy. extra oxygen is given through a nasal cannula (two small plastic tubes, or prongs, that are placed in both nostrils) or through a mask that fits over your nose and mouth. oxygen therapy oxygen also can be given through a tracheostomy (tra-ke-os-to-me). this is a surgically made hole that goes through the front of your neck and into your windpipe. a breathing tube, also called a tracheostomy or trach tube, is placed in the hole to help you breathe. tracheostomy if the oxygen level in your blood doesn't increase, or if you're still having trouble breathing, your doctor may recommend a ventilator. a ventilator is a machine that supports breathing. it blows airor air with increased amounts of oxygeninto your airways and then your lungs. ventilator your doctor will adjust the ventilator as needed. this will help your lungs get the right amount of oxygen. it also can prevent the machine's pressure from injuring your lungs. you'll use the ventilator until you can breathe on your own. other treatments to help you breathe noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (nppv) and a rocking bed are two methods that can help you breathe better while you sleep. these methods are very useful for people who have chronic respiratory failure. nppv is a treatment that uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open while you sleep. you wear a mask or other device that fits over your nose or your nose and mouth. a tube connects the mask to a machine, which blows air into the tube. cpap (continuous positive airway pressure) is one type of nppv. for more information, go to the health topics cpap article. although the article focuses on cpap treatment for sleep apnea, it explains how cpap works. a rocking bed consists of a mattress on a motorized platform. the mattress gently rocks back and forth. when your head rocks down, the organs in your abdomen and your diaphragm (the main muscle used for breathing) slide up, helping you exhale. when your head rocks up, the organs in your abdomen and your diaphragm slide down, helping you inhale. fluids you may be given fluids to improve blood flow throughout your body and to provide nutrition. your doctor will make sure you get the right amount of fluids. too much fluid can fill the lungs and make it hard for you to get the oxygen you need. not enough fluid can limit the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the body's organs. fluids usually are given through an intravenous (iv) line inserted in one of your blood vessels. medicines your doctor may prescribe medicines to relieve discomfort. treatments for the underlying cause of respiratory failure once your doctor figures out what's causing your respiratory failure, he or she will plan how to treat that disease or condition. treatments may include medicines, procedures, and other therapies."
how to prevent endocarditis ?,"if you're at risk for infective endocarditis (ie), you can take steps to prevent the infection and its complications. be alert to the signs and symptoms of ie. contact your doctor right away if you have any of these signs or symptoms, especially a persistent fever or unexplained fatigue (tiredness). brush and floss your teeth regularly, and have regular dental checkups. germs from a gum infection can enter your bloodstream. avoid body piercing, tattoos, and other procedures that may allow germs to enter your bloodstream. research shows that not everyone at risk for ie needs to take antibiotics before routine dental exams and certain other dental and medical procedures. let your health care providers, including your dentist, know if you're at risk for ie. they can tell you whether you need antibiotics before exams and procedures."
what are the symptoms of metabolic syndrome ?,"metabolic syndrome is a group of risk factors that raises your risk for heart disease and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke. these risk factors can increase your risk for health problems even if they're only moderately raised (borderline-high risk factors). most of the metabolic risk factors have no signs or symptoms, although a large waistline is a visible sign. some people may have symptoms of high blood sugar if diabetesespecially type 2 diabetesis present. symptoms of high blood sugar often include increased thirst; increased urination, especially at night; fatigue (tiredness); and blurred vision. high blood pressure usually has no signs or symptoms. however, some people in the early stages of high blood pressure may have dull headaches, dizzy spells, or more nosebleeds than usual."
how to diagnose metabolic syndrome ?,"your doctor will diagnose metabolic syndrome based on the results of a physical exam and blood tests. you must have at least three of the five metabolic risk factors to be diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. metabolic risk factors a large waistline having a large waistline means that you carry excess weight around your waist (abdominal obesity). this is also called having an ""apple-shaped"" figure. your doctor will measure your waist to find out whether you have a large waistline. a waist measurement of 35 inches or more for women or 40 inches or more for men is a metabolic risk factor. a large waistline means you're at increased risk for heart disease and other health problems. a high triglyceride level triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood. a triglyceride level of 150 mg/dl or higher (or being on medicine to treat high triglycerides) is a metabolic risk factor. (the mg/dl is milligrams per deciliterthe units used to measure triglycerides, cholesterol, and blood sugar.) a low hdl cholesterol level hdl cholesterol sometimes is called ""good"" cholesterol. this is because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries. an hdl cholesterol level of less than 50 mg/dl for women and less than 40 mg/dl for men (or being on medicine to treat low hdl cholesterol) is a metabolic risk factor. high blood pressure a blood pressure of 130/85 mmhg or higher (or being on medicine to treat high blood pressure) is a metabolic risk factor. (the mmhg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.) if only one of your two blood pressure numbers is high, you're still at risk for metabolic syndrome. high fasting blood sugar a normal fasting blood sugar level is less than 100 mg/dl. a fasting blood sugar level between 100125 mg/dl is considered prediabetes. a fasting blood sugar level of 126 mg/dl or higher is considered diabetes. a fasting blood sugar level of 100 mg/dl or higher (or being on medicine to treat high blood sugar) is a metabolic risk factor. about 85 percent of people who have type 2 diabetesthe most common type of diabetesalso have metabolic syndrome. these people have a much higher risk for heart disease than the 15 percent of people who have type 2 diabetes without metabolic syndrome."
what is (are) asthma ?,"espaol asthma (az-ma) is a chronic (long-term) lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe), chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing. the coughing often occurs at night or early in the morning. asthma affects people of all ages, but it most often starts during childhood. in the united states, more than 25 million people are known to have asthma. about 7million of these people are children. overview to understand asthma, it helps to know how the airways work. the airways are tubes that carry air into and out of your lungs. people who have asthma have inflamed airways. the inflammation makes the airways swollen and very sensitive. the airways tend to react strongly to certain inhaled substances. when the airways react, the muscles around them tighten. this narrows the airways, causing less air to flow into the lungs. the swelling also can worsen, making the airways even narrower. cells in the airways might make more mucus than usual. mucus is a sticky, thick liquid that can further narrow the airways. this chain reaction can result in asthma symptoms. symptoms can happen each time the airways are inflamed. asthma sometimes asthma symptoms are mild and go away on their own or after minimal treatment with asthma medicine. other times, symptoms continue to get worse. when symptoms get more intense and/or more symptoms occur, you're having an asthma attack. asthma attacks also are called flareups or exacerbations (eg-zas-er-ba-shuns). treating symptoms when you first notice them is important. this will help prevent the symptoms from worsening and causing a severe asthma attack. severe asthma attacks may require emergency care, and they can be fatal. outlook asthma has no cure. even when you feel fine, you still have the disease and it can flare up at any time. however, with today's knowledge and treatments, most people who have asthma are able to manage the disease. they have few, if any, symptoms. they can live normal, active lives and sleep through the night without interruption from asthma. if you have asthma, you can take an active role in managing the disease. for successful, thorough, and ongoing treatment, build strong partnerships with your doctor and other health care providers."
who is at risk for asthma? ?,"asthma affects people of all ages, but it most often starts during childhood. in the united states, more than 22 million people are known to have asthma. nearly 6 million of these people are children. young children who often wheeze and have respiratory infectionsas well as certain other risk factorsare at highest risk of developing asthma that continues beyond 6 years of age. the other risk factors include having allergies, eczema (an allergic skin condition), or parents who have asthma. among children, more boys have asthma than girls. but among adults, more women have the disease than men. it's not clear whether or how sex and sex hormones play a role in causing asthma. most, but not all, people who have asthma have allergies. some people develop asthma because of contact with certain chemical irritants or industrial dusts in the workplace. this type of asthma is called occupational asthma."
how to diagnose asthma ?,"your primary care doctor will diagnose asthma based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results. your doctor also will figure out the severity of your asthmathat is, whether it's intermittent, mild, moderate, or severe. the level of severity will determine what treatment you'll start on. you may need to see an asthma specialist if: you need special tests to help diagnose asthma you've had a life-threatening asthma attack you need more than one kind of medicine or higher doses of medicine to control your asthma, or if you have overall problems getting your asthma well controlled you're thinking about getting allergy treatments medical and family histories your doctor may ask about your family history of asthma and allergies. he or she also may ask whether you have asthma symptoms and when and how often they occur. let your doctor know whether your symptoms seem to happen only during certain times of the year or in certain places, or if they get worse at night. your doctor also may want to know what factors seem to trigger your symptoms or worsen them. for more information about possible asthma triggers, go to ""what are the signs and symptoms of asthma?"" your doctor may ask you about related health conditions that can interfere with asthma management. these conditions include a runny nose, sinus infections, reflux disease, psychological stress, and sleep apnea. physical exam your doctor will listen to your breathing and look for signs of asthma or allergies. these signs include wheezing, a runny nose or swollen nasal passages, and allergic skin conditions (such as eczema). keep in mind that you can still have asthma even if you don't have these signs on the day that your doctor examines you. diagnostic tests lung function test your doctor will use a test called spirometry (spi-rom-eh-tre) to check how your lungs are working. this test measures how much air you can breathe in and out. it also measures how fast you can blow air out. your doctor also may give you medicine and then test you again to see whether the results have improved. if the starting results are lower than normal and improve with the medicine, and if your medical history shows a pattern of asthma symptoms, your diagnosis will likely be asthma. other tests your doctor may recommend other tests if he or she needs more information to make a diagnosis. other tests may include: allergy testing to find out which allergens affect you, if any. a test to measure how sensitive your airways are. this is called a bronchoprovocation (brong-ko-prav-eh-ka-shun) test. using spirometry, this test repeatedly measures your lung function during physical activity or after you receive increasing doses of cold air or a special chemical to breathe in. a test to show whether you have another condition with the same symptoms as asthma, such as reflux disease, vocal cord dysfunction, or sleep apnea. a chest x ray or an ekg (electrocardiogram). these tests will help find out whether a foreign object or other disease may be causing your symptoms. diagnosing asthma in young children most children who have asthma develop their first symptoms before 5 years of age. however, asthma in young children (aged 0 to 5 years) can be hard to diagnose. sometimes it's hard to tell whether a child has asthma or another childhood condition. this is because the symptoms of asthma also occur with other conditions. also, many young children who wheeze when they get colds or respiratory infections don't go on to have asthma after they're 6 years old. a child may wheeze because he or she has small airways that become even narrower during colds or respiratory infections. the airways grow as the child grows older, so wheezing no longer occurs when the child gets colds. a young child who has frequent wheezing with colds or respiratory infections is more likely to have asthma if: one or both parents have asthma the child has signs of allergies, including the allergic skin condition eczema the child has allergic reactions to pollens or other airborne allergens the child wheezes even when he or she doesn't have a cold or other infection the most certain way to diagnose asthma is with a lung function test, a medical history, and a physical exam. however, it's hard to do lung function tests in children younger than 5 years. thus, doctors must rely on children's medical histories, signs and symptoms, and physical exams to make a diagnosis. doctors also may use a 46 week trial of asthma medicines to see how well a child responds."
what are the symptoms of coronary heart disease ?,"a common symptom of coronary heart disease (chd) is angina. angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs if an area of your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. angina may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. you also may feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. angina pain may even feel like indigestion. the pain tends to get worse with activity and go away with rest. emotional stress also can trigger the pain. another common symptom of chd is shortness of breath. this symptom occurs if chd causes heart failure. when you have heart failure, your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your bodys needs. fluid builds up in your lungs, making it hard to breathe. the severity of these symptoms varies. they may get more severe as the buildup of plaque continues to narrow the coronary arteries. signs and symptoms of heart problems related to coronary heart disease some people who have chd have no signs or symptomsa condition called silent chd. the disease might not be diagnosed until a person has signs or symptoms of a heart attack, heart failure, or an arrhythmia (an irregular heartbeat). heart attack a heart attack occurs if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle is cut off. this can happen if an area of plaque in a coronary artery ruptures (breaks open). blood cell fragments called platelets stick to the site of the injury and may clump together to form blood clots. if a clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery. if the blockage isnt treated quickly, the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery begins to die. healthy heart tissue is replaced with scar tissue. this heart damage may not be obvious, or it may cause severe or long-lasting problems. heart with muscle damage and a blocked artery the most common heart attack symptom is chest pain or discomfort. most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest that often lasts for more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back. the discomfort can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. the feeling can be mild or severe. heart attack pain sometimes feels like indigestion or heartburn. the symptoms of angina can be similar to the symptoms of a heart attack. angina pain usually lasts for only a few minutes and goes away with rest. chest pain or discomfort that doesnt go away or changes from its usual pattern (for example, occurs more often or while youre resting) might be a sign of a heart attack. if you dont know whether your chest pain is angina or a heart attack, call 911. all chest pain should be checked by a doctor. other common signs and symptoms of a heart attack include: upper body discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach shortness of breath, which may occur with or before chest discomfort nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), vomiting, light-headedness or fainting, or breaking out in a cold sweat sleep problems, fatigue (tiredness), or lack of energy for more information, go to the health topics heart attack article. heart failure heart failure is a condition in which your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your bodys needs. heart failure doesn't mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop working. the most common signs and symptoms of heart failure are shortness of breath or trouble breathing; fatigue; and swelling in the ankles, feet, legs, stomach, and veins in the neck. all of these symptoms are the result of fluid buildup in your body. when symptoms start, you may feel tired and short of breath after routine physical effort, like climbing stairs. for more information, go to the health topics heart failure article. arrhythmia an arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. when you have an arrhythmia, you may notice that your heart is skipping beats or beating too fast. some people describe arrhythmias as a fluttering feeling in the chest. these feelings are called palpitations (pal-pih-ta-shuns). some arrhythmias can cause your heart to suddenly stop beating. this condition is called sudden cardiac arrest (sca). sca usually causes death if it's not treated within minutes. for more information, go to the health topics arrhythmia article."
how to diagnose coronary heart disease ?,"your doctor will diagnose coronary heart disease (chd) based on your medical and family histories, your risk factors for chd, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures. no single test can diagnose chd. if your doctor thinks you have chd, he or she may recommend one or more of the following tests. ekg (electrocardiogram) an ekg is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. the test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). an ekg also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart. an ekg can show signs of heart damage due to chd and signs of a previous or current heart attack. stress testing during stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done. if you can't exercise, you may be given medicine to raise your heart rate. when your heart is working hard and beating fast, it needs more blood and oxygen. plaque-narrowed arteries can't supply enough oxygen-rich blood to meet your heart's needs. a stress test can show possible signs and symptoms of chd, such as: abnormal changes in your heart rate or blood pressure shortness of breath or chest pain abnormal changes in your heart rhythm or your heart's electrical activity if you can't exercise for as long as what is considered normal for someone your age, your heart may not be getting enough oxygen-rich blood. however, other factors also can prevent you from exercising long enough (for example, lung diseases, anemia, or poor general fitness). as part of some stress tests, pictures are taken of your heart while you exercise and while you rest. these imaging stress tests can show how well blood is flowing in your heart and how well your heart pumps blood when it beats. echocardiography echocardiography(echo) uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. the picture shows the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working. echo also can show areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow. chest x ray a chest x ray takes pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. a chest x ray can reveal signs of heart failure, as well as lung disorders and other causes of symptoms not related to chd. blood tests blood tests check the levels of certain fats, cholesterol, sugar, and proteins in your blood. abnormal levels might be a sign that you're at risk for chd. coronary angiography and cardiac catheterization your doctor may recommend coronary angiography (an-jee-og-rah-fee) if other tests or factors show that you're likely to have chd. this test uses dye and special x rays to show the insides of your coronary arteries. to get the dye into your coronary arteries, your doctor will use a procedure called cardiac catheterization (kath-eh-ter-ih-za-shun). a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. the tube is threaded into your coronary arteries, and the dye is released into your bloodstream. special x rays are taken while the dye is flowing through your coronary arteries. the dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through your heart and blood vessels. cardiac catheterization usually is done in a hospital. you're awake during the procedure. it usually causes little or no pain, although you may feel some soreness in the blood vessel where your doctor inserts the catheter."
how to prevent vasculitis ?,"you can't prevent vasculitis. however, treatment can help prevent or delay the complications of vasculitis. people who have severe vasculitis are treated with prescription medicines. rarely, surgery may be done. people who have mild vasculitis may find relief with over-the-counter pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen. for more information about vasculitis treatments, go to ""how is vasculitis treated?"""
how to prevent heart valve disease ?,"to prevent heart valve disease caused by rheumatic fever, see your doctor if you have signs of a strep infection. these signs include a painful sore throat, fever, and white spots on your tonsils. if you do have a strep infection, be sure to take all medicines prescribed to treat it. prompt treatment of strep infections can prevent rheumatic fever, which damages the heartvalves. its possible that exercise, a heart-healthy diet, and medicines that lower cholesterol might prevent aortic stenosis (thickening and stiffening of the aortic valve). researchers continue to study this possibility. heart-healthy eating, physical activity, other heart-healthy lifestyle changes, and medicines aimed at preventing a heart attack, high blood pressure, or heart failure also may help prevent heart valve disease."
what is (are) heart block ?,"heart block is a problem that occurs with the heart's electrical system. this system controls the rate and rhythm of heartbeats. (""rate"" refers to the number of times your heart beats per minute. ""rhythm"" refers to the pattern of regular or irregular pulses produced as the heart beats.) with each heartbeat, an electrical signal spreads across the heart from the upper to the lower chambers. as it travels, the signal causes the heart to contract and pump blood. heart block occurs if the electrical signal is slowed or disrupted as it moves through the heart. overview heart block is a type of arrhythmia (ah-rith-me-ah). an arrhythmia is any problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. some people are born with heart block, while others develop it during their lifetimes. if you're born with the condition, it's called congenital (kon-jen-ih-tal) heart block. if the condition develops after birth, it's called acquired heart block. doctors might detect congenital heart block before or after a baby is born. certain diseases that may occur during pregnancy can cause heart block in a baby. some congenital heart defects also can cause heart block. congenital heart defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. often, doctors don't know what causes these defects. acquired heart block is more common than congenital heart block. damage to the heart muscle or its electrical system causes acquired heart block. diseases, surgery, or medicines can cause this damage. the three types of heart block are first degree, second degree, and third degree. first degree is the least severe, and third degree is the most severe. this is true for both congenital and acquired heart block. doctors use a test called an ekg (electrocardiogram) to help diagnose heart block. this test detects and records the heart's electrical activity. it maps the data on a graph for the doctor to review. outlook the symptoms and severity of heart block depend on which type you have. first-degree heart block may not cause any severe symptoms. second-degree heart block may result in the heart skipping a beat or beats. this type of heart block also can make you feel dizzy or faint. third-degree heart block limits the heart's ability to pump blood to the rest of the body. this type of heart block may cause fatigue (tiredness), dizziness, and fainting. third-degree heart block requires prompt treatment because it can be fatal. a medical device called a pacemaker is used to treat third-degree heart block and some cases of second-degree heart block. this device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. pacemakers typically are not used to treat first-degree heart block. all types of heart block may increase your risk for other arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation (a-tre-al fih-brih-la-shun). talk with your doctor to learn more about the signs and symptoms of arrhythmias."
what are the treatments for heart block ?,"treatment depends on the type of heart block you have. if you have first-degree heart block, you may not need treatment. if you have second-degree heart block, you may need a pacemaker. a pacemaker is a small device that's placed under the skin of your chest or abdomen. this device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. if you have third-degree heart block, you will need a pacemaker. in an emergency, a temporary pacemaker might be used until you can get a long-term device. most people who have third-degree heart block need pacemakers for the rest of their lives. some people who have third-degree congenital heart block don't need pacemakers for many years. others may need pacemakers at a young age or during infancy. if a pregnant woman has an autoimmune disease, such as lupus, her fetus is at risk for heart block. if heart block is detected in a fetus, the mother might be given medicine to reduce the fetus' risk of developing serious heart block. sometimes acquired heart block goes away if the factor causing it is treated or resolved. for example, heart block that occurs after a heart attack or surgery may go away during recovery. also, if a medicine is causing heart block, the condition may go away if the medicine is stopped or the dosage is lowered. (always talk with your doctor before you change the way you take your medicines.)"
what are the symptoms of carotid artery disease ?,"carotid artery disease may not cause signs or symptoms until it severely narrows or blocks a carotid artery. signs and symptoms may include a bruit, a transient ischemic attack(tia), or a stroke. bruit during a physical exam, your doctor may listen to your carotid arteries with a stethoscope. he or she may hear a whooshing sound called a bruit. this sound may suggest changed or reduced blood flow due to plaque buildup. to find out more, your doctor may recommend tests. not all people who have carotid artery disease have bruits. transient ischemic attack (mini-stroke) for some people, having a transient ischemic attack (tia), or mini-stroke, is the first sign of carotid artery disease. during a mini-stroke, you may have some or all of the symptoms of a stroke. however, the symptoms usually go away on their own within 24 hours. stroke and mini-stroke symptoms may include: a sudden, severe headache with no known cause dizziness or loss of balance inability to move one or more of your limbs sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes sudden weakness or numbness in the face or limbs, often on just one side of the body trouble speaking or understanding speech even if the symptoms stop quickly, call 911 for emergency help. do not drive yourself to the hospital. its important to get checked and to get treatment started as soon as possible. a mini-stroke is a warning sign that youre at high risk of having a stroke. you shouldnt ignore these symptoms. getting medical care can help find possible causes of a mini-stroke and help you manage risk factors. these actions might prevent a future stroke. although a mini-stroke may warn of a stroke, it doesnt predict when a stroke will happen. a stroke may occur days, weeks, or even months after a mini-stroke. stroke the symptoms of a stroke are the same as those of a mini-stroke, but the results are not. a stroke can cause lasting brain damage; long-term disability, such as vision or speech problems or paralysis (an inability to move); or death. most people who have strokes have not previously had warning mini-strokes. getting treatment for a stroke right away is very important. you have the best chance for full recovery if treatment to open a blocked artery is given within 4 hours of symptom onset. the sooner treatment occurs, the better your chances of recovery. call 911 for emergency help as soon as symptoms occur. do not drive yourself to the hospital. its very important to get checked and to get treatment started as soon as possible. make those close to you aware of stroke symptoms and the need for urgent action. learning the signs and symptoms of a stroke will allow you to help yourself or someone close to you lower the risk of brain damage or death due to a stroke."
what is (are) sudden cardiac arrest ?,"sudden cardiac arrest (sca) is a condition in which the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating. if this happens, blood stops flowing to the brain and other vital organs. sca usually causes death if it's not treated within minutes. overview to understand sca, it helps to understand how the heart works. the heart has an electrical system that controls the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat. problems with the heart's electrical system can cause irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias. there are many types of arrhythmias. during an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm. some arrhythmias can cause the heart to stop pumping blood to the bodythese arrhythmias cause sca. sca is not the same as a heart attack. a heart attack occurs if blood flow to part of the heart muscle is blocked. during a heart attack, the heart usually doesn't suddenly stop beating. sca, however, may happen after or during recovery from a heart attack. people who have heart disease are at higher risk for sca. however, sca can happen in people who appear healthy and have no known heart disease or other risk factors for sca. outlook most people who have sca die from itoften within minutes. rapid treatment of sca with a defibrillator can be lifesaving. a defibrillator is a device that sends an electric shock to the heart to try to restore its normal rhythm. automated external defibrillators (aeds) can be used by bystanders to save the lives of people who are having sca. these portable devices often are found in public places, such as shopping malls, golf courses, businesses, airports, airplanes, casinos, convention centers, hotels, sports venues, and schools."
who is at risk for pericarditis? ?,"pericarditis occurs in people of all ages. however, men aged 20 to 50 are more likely to develop it than others. people who are treated for acute pericarditis may get it again. this may happen in 15 to 30 percent of people who have the condition. a small number of these people go on to develop chronic pericarditis."
what are the treatments for pericarditis ?,"most cases of pericarditis are mild; they clear up on their own or with rest and simple treatment. other times, more intense treatment is needed to prevent complications. treatment may include medicines and, less often, procedures or surgery. the goals of treatment include: reducing pain and inflammation treating the underlying cause, if it's known checking for complications specific types of treatment as a first step in your treatment, your doctor may advise you to rest until you feel better and have no fever. he or she may tell you to take over-the-counter, anti-inflammatory medicines to reduce pain and inflammation. examples of these medicines include aspirin and ibuprofen. you may need stronger medicine if your pain is severe. if your pain continues to be severe, your doctor may prescribe a medicine called colchicine and, possibly, prednisone (a steroid medicine). if an infection is causing your pericarditis, your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic or other medicine to treat the infection. you may need to stay in the hospital during treatment for pericarditis so your doctor can check you for complications. the symptoms of acute pericarditis can last from a few days to 3 weeks. chronic pericarditis may last several months. other types of treatment you may need treatment for complications of pericarditis. two serious complications are cardiac tamponade and chronic constrictive pericarditis. cardiac tamponade is treated with a procedure called pericardiocentesis (per-ih-kar-de-o-sen-te-sis). a needle or tube (called a catheter) is inserted into the chest wall to remove excess fluid in the pericardium. this procedure relieves pressure on the heart. the only cure for chronic constrictive pericarditis is surgery to remove the pericardium. this is known as a pericardiectomy (per-i-kar-de-ek-to-me). the treatments for these complications require hospital stays."
how to prevent pericarditis ?,"you usually can't prevent acute pericarditis. you can take steps to reduce your chance of having another acute episode, having complications, or getting chronic pericarditis. these steps include getting prompt treatment, following your treatment plan, and having ongoing medical care (as your doctor advises)."
what is (are) asbestos-related lung diseases ?,"asbestos-related lung diseases are diseases caused by exposure to asbestos (as-bes-tos) fibers. asbestos is a mineral that, in the past, was widely used in many industries. asbestos is made up of tiny fibers that can escape into the air. when breathed in, these fibers can stay in your lungs for a long time. if the fibers build up in your lungs, they can lead to: pleural plaque. in this condition, the tissue around the lungs and diaphragm (the muscle below your lungs) thickens and hardens. this tissue is called the pleura. pleural plaque usually causes no symptoms. rarely, as the pleura thickens, it can trap and compress part of the lung. this may show up as a mass on an x-ray image. pleural effusion. in this condition, excess fluid builds up in the pleural space. the pleural space is the area between the lungs and the chest wall. asbestosis (as-bes-toe-sis). in this condition, the lung tissue becomes scarred. people who have asbestosis are at greater risk for lung cancer, especially if they smoke. lung cancer. this type of cancer forms in the lung tissue, usually in the cells lining the air passages. mesothelioma (mez-o-thee-lee-o-ma). this disease is cancer of the pleura. asbestos also can cause cancer in the lining of the abdominal cavity. this lining is known as the peritoneum (per-ih-to-ne-um). asbestos-related lung diseases overview until the 1970s, asbestos was widely used in many industries in the united states. for example, it was used to insulate pipes, boilers, and ships; make brakes; strengthen cement; and fireproof many items, such as drywall. people who worked around asbestos during that time are at risk for asbestos-related lung diseases. people at highest risk include: unprotected workers who made, installed, or removed products containing asbestos. people who worked near others who did these jobs also are at risk. family members of workers who were exposed to asbestos. family members may have breathed in asbestos fibers that workers brought home on their clothes, shoes, or bodies. people who live in areas with large deposits of asbestos in the soil. this risk is limited to areas where the deposits were disturbed and asbestos fibers got into the air. asbestos fibers also can be released into the air when older buildings containing asbestos-made products are destroyed. removing these products during building renovations also can release asbestos fibers into the air. generally, being around asbestos-made products isnt a danger as long as the asbestos is enclosed. this prevents the fibers from getting into the air. people in the united states are less likely to have asbestos-related lung diseases now because the mineral is no longer widely used. the use of asbestos is heavily restricted, and rules and standards are now in place to protect workers and others from asbestos exposure. asbestos is found in only a few new products, such as gaskets used in brakes. however, many countries do not yet restrict asbestos use. people in those countries are still exposed to the mineral. outlook the outlook for people who have asbestos-related lung diseases can vary. it will depend on which disease a person has and how much it has damaged the lungs. no treatments can reverse the effects of asbestos on your lungs. however, treatments may help relieve symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and prevent complications. if you've been exposed to asbestos, let your doctor know. he or she can watch you for signs of asbestos-related problems and start treatment early, if needed. early treatment may help prevent or delay complications. quitting smoking and making other lifestyle changes may help people who are at high risk for asbestos-related lung diseases. these lifestyle changes may prevent more serious diseases, such as cancer."
what is (are) idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ?,"pulmonary fibrosis (pull-mun-ary fi-bro-sis) is a disease in which tissue deep in your lungs becomes thick and stiff, or scarred, over time. the formation of scar tissue is called fibrosis. as the lung tissue thickens, your lungs can't properly move oxygen into your bloodstream. as a result, your brain and other organs don't get the oxygen they need. (for more information, go to the ""how the lungs work"" section of this article.) sometimes doctors can find out what's causing fibrosis. but in most cases, they can't find a cause. they call these cases idiopathic (id-ee-o-path-ick) pulmonary fibrosis (ipf). ipf is a serious disease that usually affects middle-aged and older adults. ipf varies from person to person. in some people, fibrosis happens quickly. in others, the process is much slower. in some people, the disease stays the same for years. ipf has no cure yet. many people live only about 3 to 5 years after diagnosis. the most common cause of death related to ipf is respiratory failure. other causes of death include pulmonary hypertension (hi-per-ten-shun), heart failure, pulmonary embolism (em-bo-lizm), pneumonia (nu-mo-ne-ah), and lung cancer. genetics may play a role in causing ipf. if more than one member of your family has ipf, the disease is called familial ipf. research has helped doctors learn more about ipf. as a result, they can more quickly diagnose the disease now than in the past. also, researchers are studying several medicines that may slow the progress of ipf. these efforts may improve the lifespan and quality of life for people who have the disease."
what are the symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ?,"the signs and symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) develop over time. they may not even begin to appear until the disease has done serious damage to your lungs. once they occur, they're likely to get worse over time. the most common signs and symptoms are: shortness of breath. this usually is the main symptom of ipf. at first, you may be short of breath only during exercise. over time, you'll likely feel breathless even at rest. a dry, hacking cough that doesn't get better. over time, you may have repeated bouts of coughing that you can't control. other signs and symptoms that you may develop over time include: rapid, shallow breathing gradual, unintended weight loss fatigue (tiredness) or malaise (a general feeling of being unwell) aching muscles and joints clubbing, which is the widening and rounding of the tips of the fingers or toes clubbing ipf may lead to other medical problems, including a collapsed lung, lung infections, blood clots in the lungs, and lung cancer. as the disease worsens, you may develop other potentially life-threatening conditions, including respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension, and heart failure."
what causes overweight and obesity ?,"lack of energy balance a lack of energy balance most often causes overweight and obesity. energy balance means that your energy in equals your energy out. energy in is the amount of energy or calories you get from food and drinks. energy out is the amount of energy your body uses for things like breathing, digesting, and being physically active. to maintain a healthy weight, your energy in and out don't have to balance exactly every day. it's the balance over time that helps you maintain a healthy weight. the same amount of energy in and energy out over time = weight stays the same more energy in than energy out over time = weight gain more energy out than energy in over time = weight loss overweight and obesity happen over time when you take in more calories than you use. other causes an inactive lifestyle many americans aren't very physically active. one reason for this is that many people spend hours in front of tvs and computers doing work, schoolwork, and leisure activities. in fact, more than 2 hours a day of regular tv viewing time has been linked to overweight and obesity. other reasons for not being active include: relying on cars instead of walking, fewer physical demands at work or at home because of modern technology and conveniences, and lack of physical education classes in schools. people who are inactive are more likely to gain weight because they don't burn the calories that they take in from food and drinks. an inactive lifestyle also raises your risk for coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, colon cancer, and other health problems. environment our environment doesn't support healthy lifestyle habits; in fact, it encourages obesity. some reasons include: lack of neighborhood sidewalks and safe places for recreation. not having area parks, trails, sidewalks, and affordable gyms makes it hard for people to be physically active. work schedules. people often say that they don't have time to be physically active because of long work hours and time spent commuting. oversized food portions. americans are exposed to huge food portions in restaurants, fast food places, gas stations, movie theaters, supermarkets, and even at home. some of these meals and snacks can feed two or more people. eating large portions means too much energy in. over time, this will cause weight gain if it isn't balanced with physical activity. lack of access to healthy foods. some people don't live in neighborhoods that have supermarkets that sell healthy foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables. or, for some people, these healthy foods are too costly. food advertising. americans are surrounded by ads from food companies. often children are the targets of advertising for high-calorie, high-fat snacks and sugary drinks. the goal of these ads is to sway people to buy these high-calorie foods, and often they do. genes and family history studies of identical twins who have been raised apart show that genes have a strong influence on a person's weight. overweight and obesity tend to run in families. your chances of being overweight are greater if one or both of your parents are overweight or obese. your genes also may affect the amount of fat you store in your body and where on your body you carry the extra fat. because families also share food and physical activity habits, a link exists between genes and the environment. children adopt the habits of their parents. a child who has overweight parents who eat high-calorie foods and are inactive will likely become overweight too. however, if the family adopts healthy food and physical activity habits, the child's chance of being overweight or obese is reduced. health conditions some hormone problems may cause overweight and obesity, such as underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), cushing's syndrome, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos). underactive thyroid is a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormone. lack of thyroid hormone will slow down your metabolism and cause weight gain. you'll also feel tired and weak. cushing's syndrome is a condition in which the body's adrenal glands make too much of the hormone cortisol. cushing's syndrome also can develop if a person takes high doses of certain medicines, such as prednisone, for long periods. people who have cushing's syndrome gain weight, have upper-body obesity, a rounded face, fat around the neck, and thin arms and legs. pcos is a condition that affects about 510 percent of women of childbearing age. women who have pcos often are obese, have excess hair growth, and have reproductive problems and other health issues. these problems are caused by high levels of hormones called androgens. medicines certain medicines may cause you to gain weight. these medicines include some corticosteroids, antidepressants, and seizure medicines. these medicines can slow the rate at which your body burns calories, increase your appetite, or cause your body to hold on to extra water. all of these factors can lead to weight gain. emotional factors some people eat more than usual when they're bored, angry, or stressed. over time, overeating will lead to weight gain and may cause overweight or obesity. smoking some people gain weight when they stop smoking. one reason is that food often tastes and smells better after quitting smoking. another reason is because nicotine raises the rate at which your body burns calories, so you burn fewer calories when you stop smoking. however, smoking is a serious health risk, and quitting is more important than possible weight gain. age as you get older, you tend to lose muscle, especially if you're less active. muscle loss can slow down the rate at which your body burns calories. if you don't reduce your calorie intake as you get older, you may gain weight. midlife weight gain in women is mainly due to aging and lifestyle, but menopause also plays a role. many women gain about 5 pounds during menopause and have more fat around the waist than they did before. pregnancy during pregnancy, women gain weight to support their babies growth and development. after giving birth, some women find it hard to lose the weight. this may lead to overweight or obesity, especially after a few pregnancies. lack of sleep research shows that lack of sleep increases the risk of obesity. for example, one study of teenagers showed that with each hour of sleep lost, the odds of becoming obese went up. lack of sleep increases the risk of obesity in other age groups as well. people who sleep fewer hours also seem to prefer eating foods that are higher in calories and carbohydrates, which can lead to overeating, weight gain, and obesity. sleep helps maintain a healthy balance of the hormones that make you feel hungry (ghrelin) or full (leptin). when you don't get enough sleep, your level of ghrelin goes up and your level of leptin goes down. this makes you feel hungrier than when you're well-rested. sleep also affects how your body reacts to insulin, the hormone that controls your blood glucose (sugar) level. lack of sleep results in a higher than normal blood sugar level, which may increase your risk for diabetes. for more information, go to the health topics sleep deprivation and deficiency article."
what are the treatments for overweight and obesity ?,"successful weight-loss treatments include setting goals and making lifestyle changes, such as eating fewer calories and being physically active. medicines and weight-loss surgery also are options for some people if lifestyle changes aren't enough. set realistic goals setting realistic weight-loss goals is an important first step to losing weight. for adults try to lose 5 to 10 percent of your current weight over 6 months. this will lower your risk for coronary heart disease (chd) and other conditions. the best way to lose weight is slowly. a weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds a week is do-able, safe, and will help you keep off the weight. it also will give you the time to make new, healthy lifestyle changes. if you've lost 10 percent of your body weight, have kept it off for 6 months, and are still overweight or obese, you may want to consider further weight loss. for children and teens if your child is overweight or at risk for overweight or obesity, the goal is to maintain his or her current weight and to focus on eating healthy and being physically active. this should be part of a family effort to make lifestyle changes. if your child is overweight or obese and has a health condition related to overweight or obesity, your doctor may refer you to a pediatric obesity treatment center. lifestyle changes lifestyle changes can help you and your family achieve long-term weight-loss success. example of lifestyle changes include: focusing on balancing energy in (calories from food and drinks) with energy out (physical activity) following a healthy eating plan learning how to adopt healthy lifestyle habits over time, these changes will become part of your everyday life. calories cutting back on calories (energy in) will help you lose weight. to lose 1 to 2pounds a week, adults should cut back their calorie intake by 500 to 1,000calories a day. in general, having 1,000 to 1,200 calories a day will help most women lose weight safely. in general, having 1,200 to 1,600 calories a day will help most men lose weight safely. this calorie range also is suitable for women who weigh 165pounds or more or who exercise routinely. these calorie levels are a guide and may need to be adjusted. if you eat 1,600calories a day but don't lose weight, then you may want to cut back to 1,200calories. if you're hungry on either diet, then you may want to add 100 to 200calories a day. very low-calorie diets with fewer than 800 calories a day shouldn't be used unless your doctor is monitoring you. for overweight children and teens, it's important to slow the rate of weight gain. however, reduced-calorie diets aren't advised unless you talk with a health care provider. healthy eating plan a healthy eating plan gives your body the nutrients it needs every day. it has enough calories for good health, but not so many that you gain weight. a healthy eating plan is low in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and added sugar. following a healthy eating plan will lower your risk for heart disease and other conditions. healthy foods include: fat-free and low-fat dairy products, such as low-fat yogurt, cheese, and milk. protein foods, such as lean meat, fish, poultry without skin, beans, and peas. whole-grain foods, such as whole-wheat bread, oatmeal, and brown rice. other grain foods include pasta, cereal, bagels, bread, tortillas, couscous, and crackers. fruits, which can be fresh, canned, frozen, or dried. vegetables, which can be fresh, canned (without salt), frozen, or dried. canola and olive oils, and soft margarines made from these oils, are heart healthy. however, you should use them in small amounts because they're high in calories. you also can include unsalted nuts, like walnuts and almonds, in your diet as long as you limit the amount you eat (nuts also are high in calories). the national heart, lung, and blood institute's ""aim for a healthy weight"" patient booklet provides more information about following a healthy eating plan. foods to limit. foods that are high in saturated and trans fats and cholesterol raise blood cholesterol levels and also might be high in calories. fats and cholesterol raise your risk for heart disease, so they should be limited. saturated fat is found mainly in: fatty cuts of meat, such as ground beef, sausage, and processed meats (for example, bologna, hot dogs, and deli meats) poultry with the skin high-fat dairy products like whole-milk cheeses, whole milk, cream, butter, and ice cream lard, coconut, and palm oils, which are found in many processed foods trans fat is found mainly in: foods with partially hydrogenated oils, such as many hard margarines and shortening baked products and snack foods, such as crackers, cookies, doughnuts, and breads foods fried in hydrogenated shortening, such as french fries and chicken cholesterol mainly is found in: egg yolks organ meats, such as liver shrimp whole milk or whole-milk products, such as butter, cream, and cheese limiting foods and drinks with added sugars, like high-fructose corn syrup, is important. added sugars will give you extra calories without nutrients like vitamins and minerals. added sugars are found in many desserts, canned fruit packed in syrup, fruit drinks, and nondiet drinks. check the list of ingredients on food packages for added sugars like high-fructose corn syrup. drinks that contain alcohol also will add calories, so it's a good idea to limit your alcohol intake. portion size. a portion is the amount of food that you choose to eat for a meal or snack. it's different from a serving, which is a measured amount of food and is noted on the nutrition facts label on food packages. anyone who has eaten out lately is likely to notice how big the portions are. in fact, over the past 40 years, portion sizes have grown significantly. these growing portion sizes have changed what we think of as a normal portion. cutting back on portion size is a good way to eat fewer calories and balance your energy in. food weight. studies have shown that we all tend to eat a constant ""weight"" of food. ounce for ounce, our food intake is fairly consistent. knowing this, you can lose weight if you eat foods that are lower in calories and fat for a given amount of food. for example, replacing a full-fat food product that weighs 2 ounces with a low-fat product that weighs the same helps you cut back on calories. another helpful practice is to eat foods that contain a lot of water, such as vegetables, fruits, and soups. physical activity being physically active and eating fewer calories will help you lose weight and keep weight off over time. physical activity also will benefit you in other ways. it will: lower your risk for heart disease, heart attack, diabetes, and cancers (such as breast, uterine, and colon cancers) strengthen your heart and help your lungs work better strengthen your muscles and keep your joints in good condition slow bone loss give you more energy help you relax and better cope with stress allow you to fall asleep more quickly and sleep more soundly give you an enjoyable way to share time with friends and family the four main types of physical activity are aerobic, muscle-strengthening, bone strengthening, and stretching. you can do physical activity with light, moderate, or vigorous intensity. the level of intensity depends on how hard you have to work to do the activity. people vary in the amount of physical activity they need to control their weight. many people can maintain their weight by doing 150 to 300 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes to 5 hours) of moderate-intensity activity per week, such as brisk walking. people who want to lose a large amount of weight (more than 5 percent of their body weight) may need to do more than 300 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week. this also may be true for people who want to keep off weight that they've lost. you don't have to do the activity all at once. you can break it up into short periods of at least 10 minutes each. if you have a heart problem or chronic disease, such as heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure, talk with your doctor about what types of physical activity are safe for you. you also should talk with your doctor about safe physical activities if you have symptoms such as chest pain or dizziness. children should get at least 60 minutes or more of physical activity every day. most physical activity should be moderate-intensity aerobic activity. activity should vary and be a good fit for the child's age and physical development. many people lead inactive lives and might not be motivated to do more physical activity. when starting a physical activity program, some people may need help and supervision to avoid injury. if you're obese, or if you haven't been active in the past, start physical activity slowly and build up the intensity a little at a time. when starting out, one way to be active is to do more everyday activities, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator and doing household chores and yard work. the next step is to start walking, biking, or swimming at a slow pace, and then build up the amount of time you exercise or the intensity level of the activity. to lose weight and gain better health, it's important to get moderate-intensity physical activity. choose activities that you enjoy and that fit into your daily life. a daily, brisk walk is an easy way to be more active and improve your health. use a pedometer to count your daily steps and keep track of how much you're walking. try to increase the number of steps you take each day. other examples of moderate-intensity physical activity include dancing, gardening, and water aerobics. for greater health benefits, try to step up your level of activity or the length of time you're active. for example, start walking for 10 to 15 minutes three times a week, and then build up to brisk walking for 60 minutes, 5 days a week. for more information about physical activity, go to the department of health and human services ""2008 physical activity guidelines for americans"" and the health topics physical activity and your heart article. behavioral changes changing your behaviors or habits related to food and physical activity is important for losing weight. the first step is to understand which habits lead you to overeat or have an inactive lifestyle. the next step is to change these habits. below are some simple tips to help you adopt healthier habits. change your surroundings. you might be more likely to overeat when watching tv, when treats are available at work, or when you're with a certain friend. you also might find it hard to motivate yourself to be physically active. however, you can change these habits. instead of watching tv, dance to music in your living room or go for a walk. leave the office break room right after you get a cup of coffee. bring a change of clothes to work. head straight to an exercise class on the way home from work. put a note on your calendar to remind yourself to take a walk or go to your exercise class. keep a record. a record of your food intake and the amount of physical activity that you do each day will help inspire you. you also can keep track of your weight. for example, when the record shows that you've been meeting your physical activity goals, you'll want to keep it up. a record also is an easy way to track how you're doing, especially if you're working with a registered dietitian or nutritionist. seek support. ask for help or encouragement from your friends, family, and health care provider. you can get support in person, through e-mail, or by talking on the phone. you also can join a support group. reward success. reward your success for meeting your weight-loss goals or other achievements with something you would like to do, not with food. choose rewards that you'll enjoy, such as a movie, music cd, an afternoon off from work, a massage, or personal time. weight-loss medicines weight-loss medicines approved by the food and drug administration (fda) might be an option for some people. if you're not successful at losing 1 pound a week after 6months of using lifestyle changes, medicines may help. you should only use medicines as part of a program that includes diet, physical activity, and behavioral changes. weight-loss medicines might be suitable for adults who are obese (a bmi of 30 or greater). people who have bmis of 27 or greater, and who are at risk for heart disease and other health conditions, also may benefit from weight-loss medicines. sibutramine (meridia) as of october 2010, the weight-loss medicine sibutramine (meridia) was taken off the market in the united states. research showed that the medicine may raise the risk of heart attack and stroke. orlistat (xenical and alli) orlistat (xenical) causes a weight loss between 5 and 10 pounds, although some people lose more weight. most of the weight loss occurs within the first 6 months of taking the medicine. people taking xenical need regular checkups with their doctors, especially during the first year of taking the medicine. during checkups, your doctor will check your weight, blood pressure, and pulse and may recommend other tests. he or she also will talk with you about any medicine side effects and answer your questions. the fda also has approved alli, an over-the-counter (otc) weight-loss aid for adults. alli is the lower dose form of orlistat. alli is meant to be used along with a reduced-calorie, low-fat diet and physical activity. in studies, most people taking alli lost 5 to 10pounds over 6 months. both xenical and alli reduce the absorption of fats, fat calories, and vitamins a, d, e, and k to promote weight loss. both medicines also can cause mild side effects, such as oily and loose stools. although rare, some reports of liver disease have occurred with the use of orlistat. more research is needed to find out whether the medicine plays a role in causing liver disease. talk with your doctor if youre considering using xenical or alli to lose weight. he or she can discuss the risks and benefits with you. you also should talk with your doctor before starting orlistat if youre taking blood-thinning medicines or being treated for diabetes or thyroid disease. also, ask your doctor whether you should take a multivitamin due to the possible loss of some vitamins. lorcaserin hydrochloride (belviq) and qsymia in july 2012, the fda approved two new medicines for chronic (ongoing) weight management. lorcaserin hydrochloride (belviq) and qsymia are approved for adults who have a bmi of 30 or greater. (qsymia is a combination of two fda-approved medicines: phentermine and topiramate.) these medicines also are approved for adults with a bmi of 27 or greater who have at least one weight-related condition, such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high blood cholesterol. both medicines are meant to be used along with a reduced-calorie diet and physical activity. other medicines some prescription medicines are used for weight loss, but aren't fda-approved for treating obesity. they include: medicines to treat depression. some medicines for depression cause an initial weight loss and then a regain of weight while taking the medicine. medicines to treat seizures. two medicines used for seizures, topiramate and zonisamide, have been shown to cause weight loss. these medicines are being studied to see whether they will be useful in treating obesity. medicines to treat diabetes. metformin may cause small amounts of weight loss in people who have obesity and diabetes. it's not known how this medicine causes weight loss, but it has been shown to reduce hunger and food intake. over-the-counter products some otc products claim to promote weight loss. the fda doesn't regulate these products because they're considered dietary supplements, not medicines. however, many of these products have serious side effects and generally aren't recommended. some of these otc products include: ephedra (also called ma huang). ephedra comes from plants and has been sold as a dietary supplement. the active ingredient in the plant is called ephedrine. ephedra can cause short-term weight loss, but it also has serious side effects. it causes high blood pressure and stresses the heart. in 2004, the fda banned the sale of dietary supplements containing ephedra in the united states. chromium. this is a mineral that's sold as a dietary supplement to reduce body fat. while studies haven't found any weight-loss benefit from chromium, there are few serious side effects from taking it. diuretics and herbal laxatives. these products cause you to lose water weight, not fat. they also can lower your body's potassium levels, which may cause heart and muscle problems. hoodia. hoodia is a cactus that's native to africa. it's sold in pill form as an appetite suppressant. however, no firm evidence shows that hoodia works. no large-scale research has been done on humans to show whether hoodia is effective or safe. weight-loss surgery weight-loss surgery might be an option for people who have extreme obesity (bmi of 40 or more) when other treatments have failed. weight-loss surgery also is an option for people who have a bmi of 35 or more and life-threatening conditions, such as: severe sleep apnea (a condition in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep) obesity-related cardiomyopathy (kar-de-o-mi-op-ah-thee; diseases of the heart muscle) severe type 2 diabetes types of weight-loss surgery two common weight-loss surgeries include banded gastroplasty and roux-en-y gastric bypass. for gastroplasty, a band or staples are used to create a small pouch at the top of your stomach. this surgery limits the amount of food and liquids the stomach can hold. for gastric bypass, a small stomach pouch is created with a bypass around part of the small intestine where most of the calories you eat are absorbed. this surgery limits food intake and reduces the calories your body absorbs. weight-loss surgery can improve your health and weight. however, the surgery can be risky, depending on your overall health. gastroplasty has few long-term side effects, but you must limit your food intake dramatically. gastric bypass has more side effects. they include nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), bloating, diarrhea, and faintness. these side effects are all part of a condition called dumping syndrome. after gastric bypass, you may need multivitamins and minerals to prevent nutrient deficiencies. lifelong medical followup is needed after both surgeries. your doctor also may recommend a program both before and after surgery to help you with diet, physical activity, and coping skills. if you think you would benefit from weight-loss surgery, talk with your doctor. ask whether you're a candidate for the surgery and discuss the risks, benefits, and what to expect. weight-loss maintenance maintaining your weight loss over time can be a challenge. for adults, weight loss is a success if you lose at least 10 percent of your initial weight and you don't regain more than 6 or 7 pounds in 2 years. you also must keep a lower waist circumference (at least 2 inches lower than your waist circumference before you lost weight). after 6 months of keeping off the weight, you can think about losing more if: you've already lost 5 to 10 percent of your body weight you're still overweight or obese the key to losing more weight or maintaining your weight loss is to continue with lifestyle changes. adopt these changes as a new way of life. if you want to lose more weight, you may need to eat fewer calories and increase your activity level. for example, if you eat 1,600 calories a day but don't lose weight, you may want to cut back to 1,200 calories. it's also important to make physical activity part of your normal daily routine."
what are the symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia ?,"the signs and symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia depend on its severity. mild to moderate iron-deficiency anemia may have no signs or symptoms. when signs and symptoms do occur, they can range from mild to severe. many of the signs and symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia apply to all types of anemia. signs and symptoms of anemia the most common symptom of all types of anemia is fatigue (tiredness). fatigue occurs because your body doesn't have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to its many parts. also, the red blood cells your body makes have less hemoglobin than normal. hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells. it helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. anemia also can cause shortness of breath, dizziness, headache, coldness in your hands and feet, pale skin, chest pain, weakness, and fatigue (tiredness). if you don't have enough hemoglobin-carrying red blood cells, your heart has to work harder to move oxygen-rich blood through your body. this can lead to irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias (ah-rith-me-ahs), a heart murmur, an enlarged heart, or even heart failure. in infants and young children, signs of anemia include poor appetite, slowed growth and development, and behavioral problems. signs and symptoms of iron deficiency signs and symptoms of iron deficiency may include brittle nails, swelling or soreness of the tongue, cracks in the sides of the mouth, an enlarged spleen, and frequent infections. people who have iron-deficiency anemia may have an unusual craving for nonfood items, such as ice, dirt, paint, or starch. this craving is called pica (pi-ka or pe-ka). some people who have iron-deficiency anemia develop restless legs syndrome (rls). rls is a disorder that causes a strong urge to move the legs. this urge to move often occurs with strange and unpleasant feelings in the legs. people who have rls often have a hard time sleeping. iron-deficiency anemia can put children at greater risk for lead poisoning and infections. some signs and symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia are related to the condition's causes. for example, a sign of intestinal bleeding is bright red blood in the stools or black, tarry-looking stools. very heavy menstrual bleeding, long periods, or other vaginal bleeding may suggest that a woman is at risk for iron-deficiency anemia."
who is at risk for atrial fibrillation? ?,"atrial fibrillation (af) affects millions of people, and the number is rising. men are more likely than women to have the condition. in the united states, af is more common among whites than african americans or hispanic americans. the risk of af increases as you age. this is mostly because your risk for heart disease and other conditions that can cause af also increases as you age. however, about half of the people who have af are younger than 75. af is uncommon in children. major risk factors af is more common in people who have: high blood pressure coronary heart disease (chd) heart failure rheumatic (ru-mat-ik) heart disease structural heart defects, such as mitral valve prolapse pericarditis (per-i-kar-di-tis; a condition in which the membrane, or sac, around your heart is inflamed) congenital heart defects sick sinus syndrome (a condition in which the heart's electrical signals don't fire properly and the heart rate slows down; sometimes the heart will switch back and forth between a slow rate and a fast rate) af also is more common in people who are having heart attacks or who have just had surgery. other risk factors other conditions that raise your risk for af include hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone), obesity, diabetes, and lung disease. certain factors also can raise your risk for af. for example, drinking large amounts of alcohol, especially binge drinking, raises your risk. even modest amounts of alcohol can trigger af in some people. caffeine or psychological stress also may trigger af in some people. some data suggest that people who have sleep apnea are at greater risk for af. sleep apnea is a common disorder that causes one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep. metabolic syndrome also raises your risk for af. metabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk for chd and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke. research suggests that people who receive high-dose steroid therapy are at increased risk for af. this therapy is used for asthma and some inflammatory conditions. it may act as a trigger in people who have other af risk factors. genetic factors also may play a role in causing af. however, their role isn't fully known."
what is (are) tetralogy of fallot ?,"tetralogy (teh-tral-o-je) of fallot (fah-lo) is a congenital heart defect. this is a problem with the heart's structure that's present at birth. congenital heart defects change the normal flow of blood through the heart. tetralogy of fallot is a rare, complex heart defect. it occurs in about 5out of every 10,000 babies. the defect affects boys and girls equally. to understand tetralogy of fallot, it helps to know how a healthy heart works. the health topics how the heart works article describes the structure and function of a healthy heart. the article also has animations that show how your heart pumps blood and how your heart's electrical system works. overview tetralogy of fallot involves four heart defects: a large ventricular septal defect (vsd) pulmonary (pull-mun-ary) stenosis right ventricular hypertrophy (hi-per-tro-fe) an overriding aorta ventricular septal defect the heart has an inner wall that separates the two chambers on its left side from the two chambers on its right side. this wall is called a septum. the septum prevents blood from mixing between the two sides of the heart. a vsd is a hole in the septum between the heart's two lower chambers, the ventricles. the hole allows oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to mix with oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle. pulmonary stenosis this defect involves narrowing of the pulmonary valve and the passage from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery. normally, oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle flows through the pulmonary valve and into the pulmonary artery. from there, the blood travels to the lungs to pick up oxygen. in pulmonary stenosis, the pulmonary valve cannot fully open. thus, the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the valve. as a result, not enough blood reaches the lungs. right ventricular hypertrophy with this defect, the muscle of the right ventricle is thicker than usual. this occurs because the heart has to work harder than normal to move blood through the narrowed pulmonary valve. overriding aorta this defect occurs in the aorta, the main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the body. in a healthy heart, the aorta is attached to the left ventricle. this allows only oxygen-rich blood to flow to the body. in tetralogy of fallot, the aorta is located between the left and right ventricles, directly over the vsd. as a result, oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle flows directly into the aorta instead of into the pulmonary artery. outlook with tetralogy of fallot, not enough blood is able to reach the lungs to get oxygen, and oxygen-poor blood flows to the body. cross-section of a normal heart and a heart with tetralogy of fallot babies and children who have tetralogy of fallot have episodes of cyanosis (si-ah-no-sis). cyanosis is a bluish tint to the skin, lips, and fingernails. it occurs because the oxygen level in the blood leaving the heart is below normal. tetralogy of fallot is repaired with open-heart surgery, either soon after birth or later in infancy. the timing of the surgery will depend on how narrow the pulmonary artery is. over the past few decades, the diagnosis and treatment of tetralogy of fallot have greatly improved. most children who have this heart defect survive to adulthood. however, they'll need lifelong medical care from specialists to help them stay as healthy as possible."
who is at risk for marfan syndrome? ?,"people at highest risk for marfan syndrome are those who have a family history of the condition. if you have marfan syndrome, you have a 50 percent chance of passing the altered gene to each of your children. marfan syndrome affects about 1 out of every 5,000 people in the united states. men, women, and children, and people of all races, can have the condition."
what are the treatments for marfan syndrome ?,"marfan syndrome has no cure. however, treatments can help delay or prevent complications, especially when started early. marfan syndrome can affect many parts of your body, including your heart, bones and joints, eyes, nervous system, and lungs. the type of treatment you receive will depend on your signs and symptoms. heart treatments aortic dilation, or aortic aneurysm, is the most common and serious heart problem linked to marfan syndrome. in this condition, the aortathe main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood to your bodystretches and grows weak. medicines are used to try to slow the rate of aortic dilation. surgery is used to replace the dilated segment of aorta before it tears. if you have marfan syndrome, you'll need routine care and tests to check your heart valves and aorta. medicines beta blockers are medicines that help your heart beat slower and with less force. these medicines may help relieve strain on your aorta and slow the rate of aortic dilation. some people have side effects from beta blockers, such as tiredness and nausea (feeling sick to your stomach). if side effects occur, your doctor may prescribe a calcium channel blocker or ace inhibitor instead of a beta blocker. both medicines help relieve stress on the aorta. studies suggest that blocking a protein called tgf-beta may help prevent some of the effects of marfan syndrome. research shows that the medicine losartan may block the protein in other conditions. the national heart, lung, and blood institute currently is sponsoring a study comparing losartan to a beta blocker in children and adults who have marfan syndrome. the study's goal is to find out which medicine, if either, is best at slowing the rate of aortic dilation. surgery if your aorta stretches, it's more likely to tear (a condition called aortic dissection). to prevent this, your doctor may recommend surgery to repair or replace part of your aorta. surgery may involve: a composite valve graft. for this surgery, part of the aorta and the aortic valve are removed. the aorta is replaced with a man-made tube called a graft. a man-made valve replaces the original valve. aortic valve-sparing surgery. if your aortic valve is working well, your doctor may recommend valve-sparing surgery. for this surgery, your doctor replaces the enlarged part of your aorta with a graft. your aortic valve is left in place. after aortic surgery, you may need medicines or followup tests. for example, after a composite valve graft, your doctor will prescribe medicines called anticoagulants, or ""blood thinners."" blood thinners help prevent blood clots from forming on your man-made aortic valve. you'll need to take these medicines for the rest of your life. if you've had valve-sparing surgery, you'll only need to take blood thinners for a short time, as your doctor prescribes. if you've had a composite valve graft, you're at increased risk for endocarditis (en-do-kar-di-tis). this is an infection of the inner lining of your heart chambers and valves. your doctor may recommend that you take antibiotics before certain medical or dental procedures that increase your risk of endocarditis. your doctor also may advise you to continue taking beta blockers or other medicines after either type of aortic surgery. after surgery, you may have routine cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (mri) or cardiac computed tomography (ct) scans to check your aorta. cardiac mri is a painless test that uses radio waves and magnets to created detailed pictures of your organs and tissues. cardiac ct is a painless test that uses an x-ray machine to take clear, detailed pictures of your heart. bone and joint treatments if you have scoliosis (a curved spine), your doctor may suggest a brace or other device to prevent the condition from getting worse. severe cases of scoliosis may require surgery. some people who have marfan syndrome need surgery to repair a chest that sinks in or sticks out. this surgery is done to prevent the chest from pressing on the lungs and heart. eye treatments marfan syndrome can lead to many eye problems, such as a dislocated lens, nearsightedness, early glaucoma (high pressure in the fluid in the eyes), and cataracts (clouding of an eye's lens). glasses or contact lenses can help with some of these problems. sometimes surgery is needed. nervous system treatments marfan syndrome can lead to dural ectasia. in this condition, a substance called the dura (which covers the fluid around your brain and spinal cord) stretches and grows weak. this can cause the bones of the spine to wear away. dural ectasia usually is treated with pain medicines. lung treatments marfan syndrome may cause pneumothorax, or collapsed lung. in this condition, air or gas builds up in the space between the lungs and the chest wall. if the condition is minor, it may go away on its own. however, you may need to have a tube placed through your skin and chest wall to remove the air. sometimes surgery is needed."
what causes heart palpitations ?,"many things can cause palpitations. you may have these feelings even when your heart is beating normally or somewhat faster than normal. most palpitations are harmless and often go away on their own. however, some palpitations are signs of a heart problem. sometimes the cause of palpitations can't be found. if you start having palpitations, see your doctor to have them checked. causes not related to heart problems strong emotions you may feel your heart pounding or racing during anxiety, fear, or stress. you also may have these feelings if you're having a panic attack. vigorous physical activity intense activity can make your heart feel like its beating too hard or too fast, even though it's working normally. intense activity also can cause occasional premature (extra) heartbeats. medical conditions some medical conditions can cause palpitations. these conditions can make the heart beat faster or stronger than usual. they also can cause premature (extra) heartbeats. examples of these medical conditions include: an overactive thyroid a low blood sugar level anemia some types of low blood pressure fever dehydration (not enough fluid in the body) hormonal changes the hormonal changes that happen during pregnancy, menstruation, and the perimenopausal period may cause palpitations. the palpitations will likely improve or go away as these conditions go away or change. some palpitations that occur during pregnancy may be due to anemia. medicines and stimulants many medicines can trigger palpitations because they can make the heart beat faster or stronger than usual. medicines also can cause premature (extra) heartbeats. examples of these medicines include: inhaled asthma medicines. medicines to treat an underactive thyroid. taking too much of these medicines can cause an overactive thyroid and lead to palpitations. medicines to prevent arrhythmias. medicines used to treat irregular heart rhythms can sometimes cause other irregular heart rhythms. over-the-counter medicines that act as stimulants also may cause palpitations. these include decongestants (found in cough and cold medicines) and some herbal and nutritional supplements. caffeine, nicotine (found in tobacco), alcohol, and illegal drugs (such as cocaine and amphetamines) also can cause palpitations. causes related to heart problems some palpitations are symptoms of arrhythmias. arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. however, less than half of the people who have palpitations have arrhythmias. during an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm. an arrhythmia happens if some part of the heart's electrical system doesn't work as it should. palpitations are more likely to be related to an arrhythmia if you: have had a heart attack or are at risk for one. have coronary heart disease (chd) or risk factors for chd. have other heart problems, such as heart failure, heart valve disease, or heart muscle disease. have abnormal electrolyte levels. electrolytes are minerals, such as potassium and sodium, found in blood and body fluids. they're vital for normal health and functioning of the body."
what causes hemochromatosis ?,"the two types of hemochromatosis are primary and secondary. each type has a different cause. primary hemochromatosis primary hemochromatosis is caused by a defect in the genes that control how much iron you absorb from food. this form of the disease sometimes is called hereditary or classical hemochromatosis. primary hemochromatosis is more common than the secondary form of the disease. the genes usually involved in primary hemochromatosis are called hfe genes. faulty hfe genes cause the body to absorb too much iron. if you inherit two copies of the faulty hfe gene (one from each parent), you're at risk for iron overload and signs and symptoms of hemochromatosis. if you inherit one faulty hfe gene and one normal hfe gene, you're a hemochromatosis ""carrier."" carriers usually don't develop the disease. however, they can pass the faulty gene on to their children. estimates suggest that about 1 in 10 people in the united states are hemochromatosis carriers. if two parents are carriers of the faulty hfe gene, then each of their children has a 1 in 4 chance of inheriting two faulty hfe genes. although less common, other faulty genes also can cause hemochromatosis. researchers continue to study what changes to normal genes may cause the disease. secondary hemochromatosis secondary hemochromatosis usually is the result of another disease or condition that causes iron overload. examples of such diseases and conditions include: certain types of anemia, such as thalassemias and sideroblastic anemia atransferrinemia and aceruloplasminemiaboth are rare, inherited diseases chronic liver diseases, such as chronic hepatitis c infection, alcoholic liver disease, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis other factors also can cause secondary hemochromatosis, including: blood transfusions oral iron pills or iron injections, with or without very high vitamin c intake (vitamin c helps your body absorb iron) long-term kidney dialysis"
how to prevent hemolytic anemia ?,"you can't prevent inherited types of hemolytic anemia. one exception is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency. if you're born with g6pd deficiency, you can avoid substances that may trigger the condition. for example, avoid fava beans, naphthalene (a substance found in some moth balls), and certain medicines (as your doctor advises). some types of acquired hemolytic anemia can be prevented. for example, reactions to blood transfusions, which can cause hemolytic anemia, can be prevented. this requires careful matching of blood types between the blood donor and the recipient. prompt and proper prenatal care can help you avoid the problems of rh incompatibility. this condition can occur during pregnancy if a woman has rh-negative blood and her baby has rh-positive blood. ""rh-negative"" and ""rh-positive"" refer to whether your blood has rh factor. rh factor is a protein on red blood cells. rh incompatibility can lead to hemolytic anemia in a fetus or newborn."
how to diagnose hypersensitivity pneumonitis ?,"to diagnose hypersensitivity pneumonitis (hp), your doctor must pinpoint the antigen that's causing the disease and its source. (an antigen is a substance that your body reacts against, such as molds, dusts, and chemicals.) your doctor will ask you detailed questions about: your current and past jobs your hobbies and leisure activities the types of places where you spend time your exposure to damp and moldy places your doctor also will do a physical exam and look at test results to diagnose hp. physical exam during the physical exam, your doctor will ask about your signs and symptoms, such as coughing and weight loss. your doctor also will look for signs of hp. for example, he or she will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope for abnormal breathing sounds. hp can cause a crackling sound when you breathe. your doctor also may look for signs of pulmonary fibrosis, a possible complication of chronic (ongoing) hp. pulmonary fibrosis is a condition in which tissue deep in your lungs becomes scarred over time. your doctor also may check for clubbing. clubbing is the widening and rounding of the tips of the fingers or toes. a low level of oxygen in the blood causes this condition. diagnostic tests and procedures to help diagnose hp, your doctor may recommend or more of the following tests or procedures. chest x ray or chest computed tomography (ct) scan a chest x ray and chest ct scan create pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. these pictures can show signs of hp. lung function tests lung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs can deliver oxygen to your blood. one of these tests is spirometry (spi-rom-eh-tre). during this test, a technician will ask you to take a deep breath. then, you'll blow as hard as you can into a tube connected to a small machine. the machine is called a spirometer. the machine measures how much air you breathe out. it also measures how fast you can blow air out. pulse oximetry this test measures the amount of oxygen in your blood. a small sensor is attached to your finger or ear. the sensor uses light to estimate how much oxygen is in your blood. precipitin test this blood test looks for antibodies (proteins) that your body creates in response to antigens. the presence of these proteins may suggest hp. challenge test during this test, you're re-exposed to the suspected antigen. then, you'll be watched for signs and symptoms of hp. bronchoscopy for bronchoscopy (bron-kos-ko-pee), your doctor passes a thin, flexible tube through your nose (or sometimes your mouth), down your throat, and into your airways. at the tip of the tube are a light and mini-camera. this allows your doctor to see your windpipe and airways. your doctor may insert forceps (a device used to grab or hold things) through the tube to collect a tissue sample. you'll be given medicine to make you relaxed and sleepy during the procedure. bronchoalveolar lavage during bronchoscopy, your doctor may inject a small amount of salt water (saline) through the tube into your lungs. this method is called bronchoalveolar lavage (brong-ko-al-ve-o-lar lah-vahzh). this fluid washes the lungs and helps bring up cells from the airways and the area around the air sacs. your doctor will look at these cells under a microscope. surgical lung biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of hp, your doctor may do a surgical lung biopsy. your doctor can use a biopsy to rule out other causes of symptoms and check the condition of your lungs. for a surgical lung biopsy, your doctor takes samples of lung tissue from several places in your lungs. he or she then looks at them under a microscope. your doctor may use one of the following methods to get lung tissue samples. video-assisted thoracoscopy (thor-ah-kos-ko-pee). for this procedure, your doctor inserts a small, lighted tube with a camera (endoscope) into your chest through small cuts between your ribs. the endoscope provides a video image of your lungs and allows your doctor to collect tissue samples. this procedure is done in a hospital. you'll be given medicine to help you sleep through the procedure. thoracotomy (thor-ah-kot-o-me). for this procedure, your doctor removes a few small pieces of lung tissue through a cut in the chest wall between your ribs. thoracotomy is done in a hospital. you'll be given medicine to help you sleep through the procedure."
what is (are) cardiogenic shock ?,"cardiogenic (kar-dee-oh-je-nik) shock is a condition in which a suddenly weakened heart isn't able to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. the condition is a medical emergency and is fatal if not treated right away. the most common cause of cardiogenic shock is damage to the heart muscle from a severe heart attack. however, not everyone who has a heart attack has cardiogenic shock. in fact, on average, only about 7 percent of people who have heart attacks develop the condition. if cardiogenic shock does occur, it's very dangerous. when people die from heart attacks in hospitals, cardiogenic shock is the most common cause of death. what is shock? the medical term ""shock"" refers to a state in which not enough blood and oxygen reach important organs in the body, such as the brain and kidneys. shock causes very low blood pressure and may be life threatening. shock can have many causes. cardiogenic shock is only one type of shock. other types of shock include hypovolemic (hy-po-vo-lee-mik) shock and vasodilatory (vaz-oh-dile-ah-tor-e) shock. hypovolemic shock is a condition in which the heart cant pump enough blood to the body because of severe blood loss. in vasodilatory shock, the blood vessels suddenly relax. when the blood vessels are too relaxed, blood pressure drops and blood flow becomes very low. without enough blood pressure, blood and oxygen dont reach the bodys organs. a bacterial infection in the bloodstream, a severe allergic reaction, or damage to the nervous system (brain and nerves) may cause vasodilatory shock. when a person is in shock (from any cause), not enough blood and oxygen are reaching the body's organs. if shock lasts more than a few minutes, the lack of oxygen starts to damage the bodys organs. if shock isn't treated quickly, it can cause permanent organ damage or death. some of the signs and symptoms of shock include: confusion or lack of alertness loss of consciousness a sudden and ongoing rapid heartbeat sweating pale skin a weak pulse rapid breathing decreased or no urine output cool hands and feet if you think that you or someone else is in shock, call 911 right away for emergency treatment. prompt medical care can save your life and prevent or limit damage to your bodys organs. outlook in the past, almost no one survived cardiogenic shock. now, about half of the people who go into cardiogenic shock survive. this is because of prompt recognition of symptoms and improved treatments, such as medicines and devices. these treatments can restore blood flow to the heart and help the heart pump better. in some cases, devices that take over the pumping function of the heart are used. implanting these devices requires major surgery."
what are the treatments for cardiogenic shock ?,"cardiogenic shock is life threatening and requires emergency medical treatment. the condition usually is diagnosed after a person has been admitted to a hospital for a heart attack. if the person isn't already in a hospital, emergency treatment can start as soon as medical personnel arrive. the first goal of emergency treatment for cardiogenic shock is to improve the flow of blood and oxygen to the bodys organs. sometimes both the shock and its cause are treated at the same time. for example, doctors may quickly open a blocked blood vessel that's damaging the heart. often, this can get the patient out of shock with little or no additional treatment. emergency life support emergency life support treatment is needed for any type of shock. this treatment helps get oxygen-rich blood flowing to the brain, kidneys, and other organs. restoring blood flow to the organs keeps the patient alive and may prevent long-term damage to the organs. emergency life support treatment includes: giving the patient extra oxygen to breathe so that more oxygen reaches the lungs, the heart, and the rest of the body. providing breathing support if needed. a ventilator might be used to protect the airway and provide the patient with extra oxygen. a ventilator is a machine that supports breathing. giving the patient fluids, including blood and blood products, through a needle inserted in a vein (when the shock is due to blood loss). this can help get more blood to major organs and the rest of the body. this treatment usually isnt used for cardiogenic shock because the heart can't pump the blood that's already in the body. also, too much fluid is in the lungs, making it hard to breathe. medicines during and after emergency life support treatment, doctors will try to find out whats causing the shock. if the reason for the shock is that the heart isn't pumping strongly enough, then the diagnosis is cardiogenic shock. treatment for cardiogenic shock will depend on its cause. doctors may prescribe medicines to: prevent blood clots from forming increase the force with which the heart muscle contracts treat a heart attack medical devices medical devices can help the heart pump and improve blood flow. devices used to treat cardiogenic shock may include: an intra-aortic balloon pump. this device is placed in the aorta, the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the body. a balloon at the tip of the device is inflated and deflated in a rhythm that matches the hearts pumping rhythm. this allows the weakened heart muscle to pump as much blood as it can, which helps get more blood to vital organs, such as the brain and kidneys. a left ventricular assist device (lvad). this device is a battery-operated pump that takes over part of the hearts pumping action. an lvad helps the heart pump blood to the body. this device may be used if damage to the left ventricle, the hearts main pumping chamber, is causing shock. medical procedures and surgery sometimes medicines and medical devices aren't enough to treat cardiogenic shock. medical procedures and surgery can restore blood flow to the heart and the rest of the body, repair heart damage, and help keep a patient alive while he or she recovers from shock. surgery also can improve the chances of long-term survival. surgery done within 6 hours of the onset of shock symptoms has the greatest chance of improving survival. the types of procedures and surgery used to treat underlying causes of cardiogenic shock include: percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) and stents. pci,also known as coronary angioplasty,is a procedure used to open narrowed or blocked coronary (heart) arteries and treat an ongoing heart attack. a stent is a small mesh tube that's placed in a coronary artery during pci to help keep it open. coronary artery bypass grafting. for this surgery, arteries or veins from other parts of the body are used to bypass (that is, go around) narrowed coronary arteries. this creates a new passage for oxygen-rich blood to reach the heart. surgery to repair damaged heart valves. surgery to repair a break in the wall that separates the hearts chambers. this break is called a septal rupture. heart transplant. this type of surgery rarely is done during an emergency situation like cardiogenic shock because of other available options. also, doctors need to do very careful testing to make sure a patient will benefit from a heart transplant and to find a matching heart from a donor. still, in some cases, doctors may recommend a transplant if they feel it's the best way to improve a patient's chances of long-term survival."
what causes aneurysm ?,"the force of blood pushing against the walls of an artery combined with damage or injury to the arterys walls can cause an aneurysm. many conditions and factors can damage and weaken the walls of the aorta and cause aortic aneurysms. examples include aging, smoking, high blood pressure, and atherosclerosis (ath-er-o-skler-o-sis). atherosclerosis is the hardening and narrowing of the arteries due to the buildup of a waxy substance called plaque (plak). rarely, infectionssuch as untreated syphilis (a sexually transmitted infection)can cause aortic aneurysms. aortic aneurysms also can occur as a result of diseases that inflame the blood vessels, such as vasculitis (vas-kyu-li-tis). a family history of aneurysms also may play a role in causing aortic aneurysms. in addition to the factors above, certain genetic conditions may cause thoracic aortic aneurysms (taas). examples of these conditions include marfan syndrome, loeys-dietz syndrome, ehlers-danlos syndrome (the vascular type), and turner syndrome. these genetic conditions can weaken the bodys connective tissues and damage the aorta. people who have these conditions tend to develop aneurysms at a younger age than other people. theyre also at higher risk for rupture and dissection. trauma, such as a car accident, also can damage the walls of the aorta and lead to taas. researchers continue to look for other causes of aortic aneurysms. for example, theyre looking for genetic mutations (changes in the genes) that may contribute to or cause aneurysms."
how to diagnose insomnia ?,"your doctor will likely diagnose insomnia based on your medical and sleep histories and a physical exam. he or she also may recommend a sleep study. for example, you may have a sleep study if the cause of your insomnia is unclear. medical history to find out what's causing your insomnia, your doctor may ask whether you: have any new or ongoing health problems have painful injuries or health conditions, such as arthritis take any medicines, either over-the-counter or prescription have symptoms or a history of depression, anxiety, or psychosis are coping with highly stressful life events, such as divorce or death your doctor also may ask questions about your work and leisure habits. for example, he or she may ask about your work and exercise routines; your use of caffeine, tobacco, and alcohol; and your long-distance travel history. your answers can give clues about what's causing your insomnia. your doctor also may ask whether you have any new or ongoing work or personal problems or other stresses in your life. also, he or she may ask whether you have other family members who have sleep problems. sleep history to get a better sense of your sleep problem, your doctor will ask you for details about your sleep habits. before your visit, think about how to describe your problems, including: how often you have trouble sleeping and how long you've had the problem when you go to bed and get up on workdays and days off how long it takes you to fall asleep, how often you wake up at night, and how long it takes to fall back asleep whether you snore loudly and often or wake up gasping or feeling out of breath how refreshed you feel when you wake up, and how tired you feel during the day how often you doze off or have trouble staying awake during routine tasks, especially driving to find out what's causing or worsening your insomnia, your doctor also may ask you: whether you worry about falling asleep, staying asleep, or getting enough sleep what you eat or drink, and whether you take medicines before going to bed what routine you follow before going to bed what the noise level, lighting, and temperature are like where you sleep what distractions, such as a tv or computer, are in your bedroom to help your doctor, consider keeping a sleep diary for 1 or 2 weeks. write down when you go to sleep, wake up, and take naps. (for example, you might note: went to bed at 10 a.m.; woke up at 3 a.m. and couldn't fall back asleep; napped after work for 2 hours.) also write down how much you sleep each night, as well as how sleepy you feel throughout the day. you can find a sample sleep diary in the national heart, lung, and blood institute's ""your guide to healthy sleep."" physical exam your doctor will do a physical exam to rule out other medical problems that might cause insomnia. you also may need blood tests to check for thyroid problems or other conditions that can cause sleep problems. sleep study your doctor may recommend a sleep study called a polysomnogram (psg) if he or she thinks an underlying sleep disorder is causing your insomnia. youll likely stay overnight at a sleep center for this study. the psg records brain activity, eye movements, heart rate, and blood pressure. a psg also records the amount of oxygen in your blood, how much air is moving through your nose while you breathe, snoring, and chest movements. the chest movements show whether you're making an effort to breathe."
what is (are) von willebrand disease ?,"von willebrand disease (vwd) is a bleeding disorder. it affects your blood's ability to clot. if your blood doesn't clot, you can have heavy, hard-to-stop bleeding after an injury. the bleeding can damage your internal organs. rarely, the bleeding may even cause death. in vwd, you either have low levels of a certain protein in your blood or the protein doesn't work well. the protein is called von willebrand factor, and it helps your blood clot. normally, when one of your blood vessels is injured, you start to bleed. small blood cell fragments called platelets (plate-lets) clump together to plug the hole in the blood vessel and stop the bleeding. von willebrand factor acts like glue to help the platelets stick together and form a blood clot. von willebrand factor also carries clotting factor viii (8), another important protein that helps your blood clot. factor viii is the protein that's missing or doesn't work well in people who have hemophilia, another bleeding disorder. vwd is more common and usually milder than hemophilia. in fact, vwd is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. it occurs in about 1 out of every 100 to 1,000 people. vwd affects both males and females, while hemophilia mainly affects males. types of von willebrand disease the three major types of vwd are called type 1, type 2, and type 3. type 1 people who have type 1 vwd have low levels of von willebrand factor and may have low levels of factor viii. type 1 is the mildest and most common form of vwd. about 3 out of 4 people who have vwd have type 1. type 2 in type 2 vwd, the von willebrand factor doesn't work well. type 2 is divided into subtypes: 2a, 2b, 2m, and 2n. different gene mutations (changes) cause each type, and each is treated differently. thus, it's important to know the exact type of vwd that you have. type 3 people who have type 3 vwd usually have no von willebrand factor and low levels of factor viii. type 3 is the most serious form of vwd, but it's very rare. overview most people who have vwd have type 1, a mild form. this type usually doesn't cause life-threatening bleeding. you may need treatment only if you have surgery, tooth extraction, or trauma. treatment includes medicines and medical therapies. some people who have severe forms of vwd need emergency treatment to stop bleeding before it becomes life threatening. early diagnosis is important. with the proper treatment plan, even people who have type 3 vwd can live normal, active lives."
what causes rh incompatibility ?,"a difference in blood type between a pregnant woman and her baby causes rh incompatibility. the condition occurs if a woman is rh-negative and her baby is rh-positive. when you're pregnant, blood from your baby can cross into your bloodstream, especially during delivery. if you're rh-negative and your baby is rh-positive, your body will react to the baby's blood as a foreign substance. your body will create antibodies (proteins) against the baby's rh-positive blood. these antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the baby's red blood cells. this can lead to hemolytic anemia in the baby. rh incompatibility usually doesn't cause problems during a first pregnancy. the baby often is born before many of the antibodies develop. however, once you've formed rh antibodies, they remain in your body. thus, the condition is more likely to cause problems in second or later pregnancies (if the baby is rh-positive). with each pregnancy, your body continues to make rh antibodies. as a result, each rh-positive baby you conceive becomes more at risk for serious problems, such as severe hemolytic anemia."
how to diagnose sarcoidosis ?,"your doctor will diagnose sarcoidosis based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. he or she will look for granulomas (inflamed lumps) in your organs. your doctor also will try to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms. medical history your doctor may ask you detailed questions about your medical history. for example, he or she may ask whether you: have a family history of sarcoidosis. have had any jobs that may have raised your risk for the disease. have ever been exposed to inhaled beryllium metal. (this type of metal is used to make aircrafts and weapons.) have had contact with organic dust from birds or hay. exposure to beryllium metal and organic dust can cause inflamed lumps in your lungs that look like the granulomas from sarcoidosis. however, these lumps are signs of other conditions. physical exam your doctor will check you for signs and symptoms of sarcoidosis. signs and symptoms may include red bumps on your skin; swollen lymph nodes; an enlarged liver, spleen, or salivary glands; or redness in your eyes. your doctor also will check for other causes of your symptoms. your doctor may listen to your lungs and heart. abnormal breathing or heartbeat sounds could be a sign that sarcoidosis is affecting your lungs or heart. diagnostic tests you may have tests to confirm a diagnosis and to find out how sarcoidosis is affecting you. tests include a chest x ray, lung function tests, biopsy, and other tests to assess organ damage. chest x ray a chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart and lungs. the test may show granulomas or enlarged lymph nodes in your chest. about 95 percent of people who have sarcoidosis have abnormal chest xrays. lung function tests lung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. these tests can show whether sarcoidosis is affecting your lungs. biopsy your doctor may do a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis or rule out other causes of your symptoms. a biopsy involves taking a small sample of tissue from one of your affected organs. usually, doctors try to biopsy the organs that are easiest to access. examples include the skin, tear glands, or the lymph nodes that are just under the skin. if this isn't possible, your doctor may use a positron emission tomography (pet) scan to pinpoint areas for biopsy. for this test, a small amount of radioactive substance is injected into a vein, usually in your arm. the substance, which releases energy, travels through the blood and collects in organs or tissues. special cameras detect the energy and convert it into three-dimensional (3d) pictures. if lung function tests or a chest x ray shows signs of sarcoidosis in your lungs, your doctor may do a bronchoscopy (bron-kos-ko-pee) to get a small sample of lung tissue. during this procedure, a thin, flexible tube is passed through your nose (or sometimes your mouth), down your throat, and into the airways to reach your lung tissue. (for more information, go to the health topics bronchoscopy article.) other tests to assess organ damage you also may have other tests to assess organ damage and find out whether you need treatment. for example, your doctor may recommend blood tests and/or an ekg (electrocardiogram). if youre diagnosed with sarcoidosis, you should see an ophthalmologist (eye specialist), even if you dont have eye symptoms. in sarcoidosis, eye damage can occur without symptoms."
what are the treatments for respiratory distress syndrome ?,"treatment for respiratory distress syndrome (rds) usually begins as soon as an infant is born, sometimes in the delivery room. most infants who show signs of rds are quickly moved to a neonatal intensive care unit (nicu). there they receive around-the-clock treatment from health care professionals who specialize in treating premature infants. the most important treatments for rds are: surfactant replacement therapy. breathing support from a ventilator or nasal continuous positive airway pressure (ncpap) machine. these machines help premature infants breathe better. oxygen therapy. surfactant replacement therapy surfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs. it helps keep them open so that an infant can breathe in air once he or she is born. babies who have rds are given surfactant until their lungs are able to start making the substance on their own. surfactant usually is given through a breathing tube. the tube allows the surfactant to go directly into the baby's lungs. once the surfactant is given, the breathing tube is connected to a ventilator, or the baby may get breathing support from ncpap. surfactant often is given right after birth in the delivery room to try to prevent or treat rds. it also may be given several times in the days that follow, until the baby is able to breathe better. some women are given medicines called corticosteroids during pregnancy. these medicines can speed up surfactant production and lung development in a fetus. even if you had these medicines, your infant may still need surfactant replacement therapy after birth. breathing support infants who have rds often need breathing support until their lungs start making enough surfactant. until recently, a mechanical ventilator usually was used. the ventilator was connected to a breathing tube that ran through the infant's mouth or nose into the windpipe. today, more and more infants are receiving breathing support from ncpap. ncpap gently pushes air into the baby's lungs through prongs placed in the infant's nostrils. oxygen therapy infants who have breathing problems may get oxygen therapy. oxygen is given through a ventilator or ncpap machine, or through a tube in the nose. this treatment ensures that the infants' organs get enough oxygen to work well. for more information, go to the health topics oxygen therapy article. other treatments other treatments for rds include medicines, supportive therapy, and treatment for patent ductus arteriosus (pda). pda is a condition that affects some premature infants. medicines doctors often give antibiotics to infants who have rds to control infections (if the doctors suspect that an infant has an infection). supportive therapy treatment in the nicu helps limit stress on babies and meet their basic needs of warmth, nutrition, and protection. such treatment may include: using a radiant warmer or incubator to keep infants warm and reduce the risk of infection. ongoing monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, and temperature through sensors taped to the babies' bodies. using sensors on fingers or toes to check the amount of oxygen in the infants' blood. giving fluids and nutrients through needles or tubes inserted into the infants' veins. this helps prevent malnutrition and promotes growth. nutrition is critical to the growth and development of the lungs. later, babies may be given breast milk or infant formula through feeding tubes that are passed through their noses or mouths and into their throats. checking fluid intake to make sure that fluid doesn't build up in the babies' lungs. treatment for patent ductus arteriosus pda is a possible complication of rds. in this condition, a fetal blood vessel called the ductus arteriosus doesn't close after birth as it should. the ductus arteriosus connects a lung artery to a heart artery. if it remains open, it can strain the heart and increase blood pressure in the lung arteries. pda is treated with medicines, catheter procedures, and surgery. for more information, go to the health topics patent ductus arteriosus article."
who is at risk for obesity hypoventilation syndrome? ?,"people who are obese are at risk for obesity hypoventilation syndrome (ohs). ""obesity"" refers to having too much body fat. people who are obese have body weight that's greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height. the most useful measure of obesity is body mass index (bmi). bmi is calculated from your height and weight. in adults, a bmi of 30 or more is considered obese. you can use the national heart, lung, and blood institute's (nhlbi's) online bmi calculator to figure out your bmi, or your doctor can help you. if you are obese, you're at greater risk for ohs if your bmi is 40 or higher. you're also at greater risk if most of your excess weight is around your waist, rather than at your hips. this is referred to as ""abdominal obesity."" ohs tends to occur more often in men than women. at the time of diagnosis, most people are 40 to 60 years old."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for myotonia ?,"the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke supports and conducts an extensive research program on neuromuscular disorders. the goals of this research are to learn more about these disorders and to find ways to treat, prevent, and cure them."
what are the treatments for locked-in syndrome ?,"there is no cure for locked-in syndrome, nor is there a standard course of treatment. a therapy called functional neuromuscular stimulation, which uses electrodes to stimulate muscle reflexes, may help activate some paralyzed muscles. several devices to help communication are available. other treatment is symptomatic and supportive."
what is (are) cerebral hypoxia ?,"cerebral hypoxia refers to a condition in which there is a decrease of oxygen supply to the brain even though there is adequate blood flow. drowning, strangling, choking, suffocation, cardiac arrest, head trauma, carbon monoxide poisoning, and complications of general anesthesia can create conditions that can lead to cerebral hypoxia. symptoms of mild cerebral hypoxia include inattentiveness, poor judgment, memory loss, and a decrease in motor coordination. brain cells are extremely sensitive to oxygen deprivation and can begin to die within five minutes after oxygen supply has been cut off. when hypoxia lasts for longer periods of time, it can cause coma, seizures, and even brain death. in brain death, there is no measurable activity in the brain, although cardiovascular function is preserved. life support is required for respiration."
what is the outlook for cerebral hypoxia ?,"recovery depends on how long the brain has been deprived of oxygen and how much brain damage has occurred, although carbon monoxide poisoning can cause brain damage days to weeks after the event. most people who make a full recovery have only been briefly unconscious. the longer someone is unconscious, the higher the chances of death or brain death and the lower the chances of a meaningful recovery. during recovery, psychological and neurological abnormalities such as amnesia, personality regression, hallucinations, memory loss, and muscle spasms and twitches may appear, persist, and then resolve."
what are the treatments for microcephaly ?,"there is no treatment for microcephaly that can return a childs head to a normal size or shape. treatment focuses on ways to decrease the impact of the associated deformities and neurological disabilities. children with microcephaly and developmental delays are usually evaluated by a pediatric neurologist and followed by a medical management team. early childhood intervention programs that involve physical, speech, and occupational therapists help to maximize abilities and minimize dysfunction. medications are often used to control seizures, hyperactivity, and neuromuscular symptoms. genetic counseling may help families understand the risk for microcephaly in subsequent pregnancies."

what is (are) narcolepsy ?,"narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder caused by the brain's inability to regulate sleep-wake cycles normally. at various times throughout the day, people with narcolepsy experience irresistable bouts ofsleep. if the urge becomes overwhelming, individuals will fall asleep for periods lasting from a few seconds to several minutes. in rare cases, some people may remain asleep for an hour or longer. in addition to excessive daytime sleepiness (eds), three other major symptoms frequently characterize narcolepsy: cataplexy, or the sudden loss of voluntary muscle tone; vivid hallucinations during sleep onset or upon awakening; and brief episodes of total paralysis at the beginning or end of sleep. narcolepsy is not definitively diagnosed in most patients until 10 to 15 years after the first symptoms appear. the cause of narcolepsy remains unknown. it is likely that narcolepsy involves multiple factors interacting to cause neurological dysfunction and sleep disturbances."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for infantile refsum disease ?,"the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) conducts research related to irdin its laboratories at the national institutes of health (nih), and also supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. research is focused on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure disorders such as the pbds."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for thyrotoxic myopathy ?,the ninds supports a broad range of research on neuromuscular disorders such as thyrotoxic myopathy. much of this research is aimed at learning more about these disorders and finding ways to prevent and treat them.
what are the treatments for kleine-levin syndrome ?,"there is no definitive treatment for kleine-levin syndrome and watchful waiting at home, rather than pharmacotherapy, is most often advised. stimulant pills, including amphetamines, methylphenidate, and modafinil, are used to treat sleepiness but may increase irritability and will not improve cognitive abnormalities. because of similarities between kleine-levin syndrome and certain mood disorders, lithium and carbamazepine may be prescribed and, in some cases, have been shown to prevent further episodes. this disorder should be differentiated from cyclic re-occurrence of sleepiness during the premenstrual period in teen-aged girls, which may be controlled with birth control pills. it also should be differentiated from encephalopathy, recurrent depression, or psychosis."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for hypersomnia ?,"the ninds supports and conducts research on sleep disorders such as hypersomnia. the goal of this research is to increase scientific understanding of the condition, find improved methods of diagnosing and treating it, and discover ways to prevent it."
what are the treatments for orthostatic hypotension ?,"when orthostatic hypotension is caused by hypovolemia due to medications, the disorder may be reversed by adjusting the dosage or by discontinuing the medication. when the condition is caused by prolonged bed rest, improvement may occur by sitting up with increasing frequency each day. in some cases, physical counterpressure such as elastic hose or whole-body inflatable suits may be required. dehydration is treated with salt and fluids. more severe cases can be treated with drugs, such as midodrine, to raise blood pressure."
what are the treatments for sotos syndrome ?,there is no standard course of treatment for sotos syndrome. treatment is symptomatic.
what is the outlook for sotos syndrome ?,"sotos syndrome is not a life-threatening disorder and patients may have a normal life expectancy. the initial abnormalities of sotos syndrome usually resolve as the growth rate becomes normal after the first few years of life. developmental delays may improve in the school-age years, and adults with sotos syndrome are likely to be within the normal range for intellect and height. however, coordination problems may persist into adulthood."
what are the treatments for acid lipase disease ?,"enzyme replacement therapy for both wolman's and cholesteryl ester storage disease is currently under investigation. certain drugs may be given to help with adrenal gland production, and children may need to be fed intravenously. individuals with cesd may benefit from a low cholesterol diet."
what is the outlook for canavan disease ?,"the prognosis for canavan disease is poor. death usually occurs before age 10, although some children may survive into their teens and twenties."
what are the treatments for wallenberg's syndrome ?,"treatment for wallenberg's syndrome is symptomatic. a feeding tube may be necessary if swallowing is very difficult. speech/swallowing therapy may be beneficial. in some cases, medication may be used to reduce or eliminate pain. some doctors report that the anti-epileptic drug gabapentin appears to be an effective medication for individuals with chronic pain."
what is (are) acute disseminated encephalomyelitis ?,"acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (adem) is characterized by a brief but widespread attack of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord that damages myelin the protective covering of nerve fibers. adem often follows viral or bacterial infections, or less often, vaccination for measles, mumps, or rubella. the symptoms of adem appear rapidly, beginning with encephalitis-like symptoms such as fever, fatigue, headache, nausea and vomiting, and in the most severe cases, seizures and coma. adem typically damages white matter (brain tissue that takes its name from the white color of myelin), leading to neurological symptoms such as visual loss (due to inflammation of the optic nerve)in one or both eyes, weakness even to the point of paralysis, and difficulty coordinating voluntary muscle movements (such as those used in walking). adem is sometimes misdiagnosed as a severe first attack of multiple sclerosis (ms), since the symptoms and the appearance of the white matter injury on brain imaging may be similar. however, adem has several features which differentiate it from ms. first, unlike ms patients, persons with adem will have rapid onset of fever, a history of recent infection or immunization, and some degree of impairment of consciousness, perhaps even coma; these features are not typically seen in ms. children are more likely than adults to have adem, whereas ms is a rare diagnosis in children. in addition, adem usually consists of a single episode or attack of widespread myelin damage, while ms features many attacks over the course of time. doctors will often use imaging techniques, such as mri (magnetic resonance imaging), to search for old and new lesions (areas of damage) on the brain. the presence of older brain lesions on mri suggest that the condition may be ms rather than adem, since ms can cause brain lesions before symptoms become obvious. in rare situations, a brain biopsy may be necessary to differentiate between adem and some other diseases that involve inflammation and damage to myelin."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for spasticity ?,"the ninds supports research on brain and spinal cord disorders that can cause spasticity. the goals of this research are to increase scientific understanding about these disorders and to find ways to prevent, treat, and cure them."
what is (are) refsum disease ?,"adult refsum disease (ard) is a rare genetic disease that causes weakness or numbness of the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy). due to a genetic abnormality, people with ard disease lack the enzyme in peroxisomes that break down phytanic acid, a type of fat found in certain foods. as a result, toxic levels of phytanic acid build up in the brain, blood, and other tissues. the disease usually begins in late childhood or early adulthood with increasing night blindness due to degeneration of the retina (retinitis pigmentosa). if the disease progresses, other symptoms may include deafness, loss of the sense of smell (anosmia), problems with balance and coordination (ataxia), dry and scaly skin (ichthyosis), and heartbeat abnormalities (cardiac arrhythmias). some individuals will have shortened bones in their fingers or toes, or a visibly shortened fourth toe. although the disease usually appears in early childhood, some people will not develop symptoms until their 40s or 50s."
what is the outlook for alpers' disease ?,"the prognosis for individuals with alpers' disease is poor. those with the disease usually die within their first decade of life. continuous, unrelenting seizures often lead to death. liver failure and cardiorespiratory failure due to brain, spinal cord, and nerve involvement may also occur."
what is (are) neurofibromatosis ?,"the neurofibromatoses are genetic disorders that cause tumors to grow in the nervous system. the tumors begin in the supporting cells that make up the nerves and the myelin sheath--the thin membrane that envelops and protects the nerves. these disorders cause tumors to grow on nerves and, less frequently, in the brain and spinal cord, and produce other abnormalities such as skin changes and bone deformities. although many affected persons inherit the disorder, between 30 and 50 percent of new cases arise spontaneously through mutation (change) in an individual's genes. once this change has taken place, the mutant gene can be passed on to succeeding generations. there are three forms of neurofibromatosis (nf): - nf1 is the more common type of the disorder. symptoms of nf1, which may be evident at birth and nearly always by the time the child is 10 years old, may include light brown spots on the skin (""cafe-au-lait"" spots), two or more growths on the iris of the eye, a tumor on the optic nerve, a larger than normal head circumference, and abnormal development of the spine, a skull bone, or the tibia. - nf2 is less common and is characterized by slow-growing tumors on the vestibular branch of the right and left eighth cranial nerves, which are called vestibular schwannomas or acoustic neuromas. the tumors press on and damage neighboring nerves and reduce hearing. - the distinctive feature of schwannomatosis is the development of multiple schwannomas (tumors made up of certain cells) everywhere in the body except on the vestibular branch of the 8th cranial nerve. the dominant symptom is pain, which develops as a schwannoma enlarges or compresses nerves or adjacent tissue. some people may develop numbness, tingling, or weakness in the fingers and toes."
what is (are) febrile seizures ?,"febrile seizures are convulsions or seizures in infants or small children that are brought on by a fever. most often during a febrile seizure, a child loses consciousness and shakes uncontrollably. less commonly, a child becomes rigid or has twitches in only a portion of the body. most febrile seizures last a minute or two; some can be as brief as a few seconds, while others may last for more than 15 minutes. approximately one in every 25 children will have at least one febrile seizure. febrile seizures usually occur in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years, with the risk peaking in the second year of life. the older a child is when the first febrile seizure occurs, the less likely that child is to have more. a few factors appear to boost a child's risk of having recurrent febrile seizures, including young age (less than 18 months) during the first seizures and having immediate family members with a history of febrile seizures."
what is (are) chorea ?,"chorea is an abnormal involuntary movement disorder, one of a group of neurological disorders called dyskinesias, which are caused by overactivity of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the areas of the brain that control movement. chorea is characterized by brief, irregular contractions that are not repetitive or rhythmic, but appear to flow from one muscle to the next. chorea often occurs with athetosis, which adds twisting and writhing movements. chorea is a primary feature of huntington's disease, a progressive, hereditary movement disorder that appears in adults, but it may also occur in a variety of other conditions. syndenham's chorea occurs in a small percentage (20 percent) of children and adolescents as a complication of rheumatic fever. chorea can also be induced by drugs (levodopa, anti-convulsants, and anti-psychotics) metabolic and endocrine disorders, and vascular incidents."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for williams syndrome ?,"the national institutes of health (nih), and the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds), have funded many of the research studies exploring the genetic and neurobiological origins of ws. in the early 1990s, researchers located and identified the genetic mutation responsible for the disorder: the deletion of a small section of chromosome 7 that contains approximately 25 genes. ninds continues to support ws researchers including, for example, groups that are attempting to link specific genes with the corresponding facial, cognitive, personality, and neurological characteristics of ws."
what is the outlook for batten disease ?,"over time, affected children suffer cognitive impairment, worsening seizures, and progressive loss of sight and motor skills. eventually, children with batten disease become blind, bedridden, and demented. batten disease is often fatal by the late teens or twenties."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for batten disease ?,"the biochemical defects that underlie several ncls have recently been discovered. an enzyme called palmitoyl-protein thioesterase has been shown to be insufficiently active in the infantile form of batten disease (this condition is now referred to as cln1). in the late infantile form (cln2), a deficiency of an acid protease, an enzyme that hydrolyzes proteins, has been found as the cause of this condition. a mutated gene has been identified in juvenile batten disease (cln3), but the protein for which this gene codes has not been identified. in addition, research scientists are working with ncl animal models to improve understanding and treatment of these disorders. one research team, for example, is testing the usefulness of bone marrow transplantation in a sheep model, while other investigators are working to develop mouse models. mouse models will make it easier for scientists to study the genetics of these diseases."
what are the treatments for cavernous malformation ?,"the primary treatment option for a ccm is surgical removal. radiation therapy has not been shown to be effective. the decision to operate is made based upon the risk of approaching the lesion. for example, symptomatic lesions close to the brain surface in non eloquent brain (areas for example, those areas not involved with motor function, speech, vision, hearing, memory, and learning) are very likely to be candidates for removal. on the other hand, lesions located in deep brain areas are associated with higher surgical risk and are often not candidates for surgery until the lesion has bled multiple times. medications can often lessen general symptoms such as headache, back pain, and seizures."
what is (are) farber's disease ?,"farbers disease, also known as farber's lipogranulomatosis, describes a group of inherited metabolic disorders called lipid storage diseases, in which excess amounts of lipids (oils, fatty acids, and related compounds) build up to harmful levels in the joints, tissues, and central nervous system. the liver, heart, and kidneys may also be affected. disease onset is typically seen in early infancy but may occur later in life. symptoms of the classic form may have moderately impaired mental ability and difficulty with swallowing. other symptoms may include chronic shortening of muscles or tendons around joints. arthritis, swollen lymph nodes and joints, hoarseness, nodules under the skin (and sometimes in the lungs and other parts of the body), and vomiting. affected persons may require the insertion of a breathing tube. in severe cases, the liver and spleen are enlarged. farber's disease is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme ceramidase. the disease occurs when both parents carry and pass on the defective gene that regulates the protein sphingomyelin. children born to these parents have a 25 percent chance of inheriting the disorder and a 50 percent chance of carrying the faulty gene. the disorder affects both males and females."
what is (are) carpal tunnel syndrome ?,"carpal tunnel syndrome (cts) occurs when the median nerve, which runs from the forearm into the palm of the hand, becomes pressed or squeezed at the wrist. the carpal tunnel is a narrow, rigid passageway of ligament and bones at the base of the hand that houses the median nerve and the tendons that bend the fingers. the median nerve provides feeling to the palm side of the thumb and to most of the fingers. symptoms usually start gradually, with numbness, tingling, weakness, and sometimes pain in the hand and wrist. people might have difficulty with tasks such as driving or reading a book. decreased hand strength may make it difficult to grasp small objects or perform other manual tasks. in some cases no direct cause of the syndrome can be identified. contributing factors include trauma or injury to the wrist that causes swelling, thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and fluid retention during pregnancy. women are three times more likely than men to develop carpal tunnel syndrome. the disorder usually occurs only in adults."
what is (are) whiplash ?,"whiplash-a soft tissue injury to the neck-is also called neck sprain or neck strain. it is characterized by a collection of symptoms that occur following damage to the neck, usually because of sudden extension and flexion. the disorder commonly occurs as the result of an automobile accident and may include injury to intervertebral joints, discs, and ligaments, cervical muscles, and nerve roots. symptoms such as neck pain may be present directly after the injury or may be delayed for several days. in addition to neck pain, other symptoms may include neck stiffness, injuries to the muscles and ligaments (myofascial injuries), headache, dizziness, abnormal sensations such as burning or prickling (paresthesias), or shoulder or back pain. in addition, some people experience cognitive, somatic, or psychological conditions such as memory loss, concentration impairment, nervousness/irritability, sleep disturbances, fatigue, or depression."
what is the outlook for meralgia paresthetica ?,"meralgia paresthetica usually has a good prognosis. in most cases, meralgia paresthetica will improve with conservative treatment or may even spontaneously resolve. surgical intervention is not always fully successful."
what is (are) sturge-weber syndrome ?,sturge-weber syndrome is a neurological disorder indicated at birth by a port-wine stain birthmark on the forehead and upper eyelid of one side of the face. the birthmark can vary in color from light pink to deep purple and is caused by an overabundance of capillaries around the trigeminal nerve just beneath the surface of the face. sturge-weber syndrome is also accompanied by abnormal blood vessels on the brain surface and the loss of nerve cells and calcification of underlying tissue in the cerebral cortex of the brain on the same side of the brain as the birthmark. neurological symptoms include seizures that begin in infancy and may worsen with age. convulsions usually happen on the side of the body opposite the birthmark and vary in severity. there may be intermittent or permanent muscle weakness on the same side. some children will have developmental delays and cognitive impairment; most will have glaucoma (increased pressure within the eye) at birth or developing later. the increased pressure within the eye can cause the eyeball to enlarge and bulge out of its socket (buphthalmos). there is an increased risk for migraine headaches. sturge-weber syndrome rarely affects other body organs.
what is (are) reye's syndrome ?,"reye's syndrome (rs) is primarily a children's disease, although it can occur at any age. it affects all organs of the body but is most harmful to the brain and the liver--causing an acute increase of pressure within the brain and, often, massive accumulations of fat in the liver and other organs. rs is defined as a two-phase illness because it generally occurs in conjunction with a previous viral infection, such as the flu or chicken pox. the disorder commonly occurs during recovery from a viral infection, although it can also develop 3 to 5 days after the onset of the viral illness. rs is often misdiagnosed as encephalitis, meningitis, diabetes, drug overdose, poisoning, sudden infant death syndrome, or psychiatric illness. symptoms of rs include persistent or recurrent vomiting, listlessness, personality changes such as irritability or combativeness, disorientation or confusion, delirium, convulsions, and loss of consciousness. if these symptoms are present during or soon after a viral illness, medical attention should be sought immediately. the symptoms of rs in infants do not follow a typical pattern; for example, vomiting does not always occur. epidemiologic evidence indicates that aspirin (salicylate) is the major preventable risk factor for reye's syndrome. the mechanism by which aspirin and other salicylates trigger reye's syndrome is not completely understood. a ""reye's-like"" illness may occur in children with genetic metabolic disorders and other toxic disorders. a physician should be consulted before giving a child any aspirin or anti-nausea medicines during a viral illness, which can mask the symptoms of rs."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for generalized gangliosidoses ?,"the mission of the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease. the ninds is a part of the national institutes of health (nih), the largest supporter of biomedical research in the world. scientists are studying the mechanisms by which the lipids accumulating in these disorders cause harm to the body. ninds-funded research on the gangliosidoses also includes using variations of magnetic resonance imaging to develop a biomarker (a sign that may indicate risk of a disease and improve diagnosis) to effectively evaluate brain chemistry and disease progression, and expanding the use of virus-delivered gene therapy seen in an animal model of tay-sachs and sandhoff diseases for use in humans."
what is the outlook for transient ischemic attack ?,"tias are often warning signs that a person is at risk for a more serious and debilitating stroke. about one-third of those who have a tia will have an acute stroke some time in the future. many strokes can be prevented by heeding the warning signs of tias and treating underlying risk factors. the most important treatable factors linked to tias and stroke are high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, heart disease, carotid artery disease, diabetes, and heavy use of alcohol. medical help is available to reduce and eliminate these factors. lifestyle changes such as eating a balanced diet, maintaining healthy weight, exercising, and enrolling in smoking and alcohol cessation programs can also reduce these factors."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for normal pressure hydrocephalus ?,"the ninds conducts and supports research on neurological disorders, including normal pressure hydrocephalus. research on disorders such as normal pressure hydrocephalus focuses on increasing knowledge and understanding of the disorder, improving diagnostic techniques and neuroimaging, and finding improved treatments and preventions."
what is the outlook for anencephaly ?,"the prognosis for babies born with anencephaly is extremely poor. if the infant is not stillborn, then he or she will usually die within a few hours or days after birth."
what is (are) striatonigral degeneration ?,"striatonigral degeneration is a neurological disorder caused by a disruption in the connection between two areas of the brain-the striatum and the substantia nigra. these two areas work together to enable balance and movement. striatonigral degeneration is a type of multiple system atrophy (msa). symptoms of the disorder resemble some of those seen in parkinson's disease, including rigidity, instability, impaired speech, and slow movements."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for striatonigral degeneration ?,the ninds supports and conducts research on disorders of the brain and nervous system such as striatonigral degeneration. this research focuses on finding ways to prevent and treat these disorders.
what are the treatments for incontinentia pigmenti ?,"the skin abnormalities of ip usually disappear by adolescence or adulthood without treatment. diminished vision may be treated with corrective lenses, medication, or, in severe cases, surgery. a specialist may treat dental problems. neurological symptoms such as seizures, muscle spasms, or mild paralysis may be controlled with medication and/or medical devices and with the advice of a neurologist."
what is (are) diabetic neuropathy ?,"diabetic neuropathy is a peripheral nerve disorder caused by diabetes or poor blood sugar control. the most common types of diabetic neuropathy result in problems with sensation in the feet. it can develop slowly after many years of diabetes or may occur early in the disease. the symptoms are numbness, pain, or tingling in the feet or lower legs. the pain can be intense and require treatment to relieve the discomfort. the loss of sensation in the feet may also increase the possibility that foot injuries will go unnoticed and develop into ulcers or lesions that become infected. in some cases, diabetic neuropathy can be associated with difficulty walking and some weakness in the foot muscles. there are other types of diabetic-related neuropathies that affect specific parts of the body. for example, diabetic amyotrophy causes pain, weakness and wasting of the thigh muscles, or cranial nerve infarcts that may result in double vision, a drooping eyelid, or dizziness. diabetes can also affect the autonomic nerves that control blood pressure, the digestive tract, bladder function, and sexual organs. problems with the autonomic nerves may cause lightheadedness, indigestion, diarrhea or constipation, difficulty with bladder control, and impotence."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for infantile spasms ?,"the ninds supports broad and varied programs of research on epilepsy and other seizure disorders. this research is aimed at discovering new ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat these disorders and, ultimately, to find cures for them. hopefully, more effective and safer treatments, such as neuroprotective agents, will be developed to treat is and west syndrome."
what is (are) paraneoplastic syndromes ?,"paraneoplastic syndromes are a group of rare disorders that are triggered by an abnormal immune system response to a cancerous tumor known as a ""neoplasm."" paraneoplastic syndromes are thought to happen when cancer-fighting antibodies or white blood cells (known as t cells) mistakenly attack normal cells in the nervous system. these disorders typically affect middle-aged to older people and are most common in individuals with lung, ovarian, lymphatic, or breast cancer. neurologic symptoms generally develop over a period of days to weeks and usually occur prior to the tumor being discovered. these symptoms may include difficulty in walking or swallowing, loss of muscle tone, loss of fine motor coordination, slurred speech, memory loss, vision problems, sleep disturbances, dementia, seizures, sensory loss in the limbs, and vertigo or dizziness. paraneoplastic syndromes include lambert-eaton myasthenic syndrome, stiff-person syndrome, encephalomyelitis, myasthenia gravis, cerebellar degeneration, limbic or brainstem encephalitis, neuromyotonia, opsoclonus, and sensory neuropathy."
what is the outlook for multiple system atrophy ?,"the disease tends to advance rapidly over the course of 5 to 10 years, with progressive loss of motor skills, eventual confinement to bed, and death. there is no remission from the disease. there is currently no cure."
what is (are) miller fisher syndrome ?,"miller fisher syndrome is a rare, acquired nerve disease that is considered to be a variant of guillain-barr syndrome. it is characterized by abnormal muscle coordination, paralysis of the eye muscles, and absence of the tendon reflexes. like guillain-barr syndrome, symptoms may be preceded by a viral illness. additional symptoms include generalized muscle weakness and respiratory failure. the majority of individuals with miller fisher syndrome have a unique antibody that characterizes the disorder."
what are the treatments for miller fisher syndrome ?,treatment for miller fisher syndrome is identical to treatment for guillain-barr syndrome: intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) or plasmapheresis (a procedure in which antibodies are removed from the blood) and supportive care.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for todd's paralysis ?,"the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) conducts research related to todd's paralysis in its clinics and laboratories at the national institutes of health (nih), and supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. much of this research focuses on finding successful methods to prevent todd's paralysis in individuals with epilepsy."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for headache ?,"the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) conducts research relating to headaches at its laboratories at the national institutes of health (nih), and supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. ninds also supports and conducts studies to improve the diagnosis of headaches and to find ways to prevent them."
what is the outlook for fibromuscular dysplasia ?,"currently there is no cure for fmd. medicines and angioplasty can reduce the risk of initial or recurrent stroke. in rare cases, fmd-related aneurysms can burst and bleed into the brain, causing stroke, permanent nerve damage, or death."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for periventricular leukomalacia ?,the ninds supports and conducts research on brain injuries such as pvl. much of this research is aimed at finding ways to prevent and treat these disorders.
what is the outlook for zellweger syndrome ?,"the prognosis for infants with zellweger syndrome is poor. most infants do not survive past the first 6 months, and usually succumb to respiratory distress, gastrointestinal bleeding, or liver failure."
what is the outlook for bell's palsy ?,"the prognosis for individuals with bell's palsy is generally very good. the extent of nerve damage determines the extent of recovery. with or without treatment, most individuals begin to get better within 2 weeks after the initial onset of symptoms and recover some or all facial function within 3 to 6 months."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for bell's palsy ?,"the mission of the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) is to seek fundamental knowledge of the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease. the ninds conducts and supports an extensive research program of basic science to increase understanding of how the nervous system works and circumstances that lead to nerve damage. knowledge gained from this research may help scientists find the definitive cause of bell's palsy, leading to the discovery of new effective treatments for the disorder. other ninds-supported research is aimed at developing methods to repair damaged nerves and restore full use and strength to injured areas, and finding ways to prevent nerve damage and injuries from occurring."
what is (are) aicardi-goutieres syndrome disorder ?,"aicardi-goutieres syndrome (ags) is an inherited encephalopathy that affects newborn infants and usually results in severe mental and physical handicap. there are two forms of the syndrome: an early-onset form that is severe, and a late-onset form that has less impact upon neurological function. the early-onset form affects about 20 percent of all babies who have ags. these infants are born with neurological and liver abnormalities, such as enlargement of the liver and spleen and elevated liver enzymes. their jittery behavior and poor feeding ability mimic congenital viral infection. babies with later-onset ags begin having symptoms after the first weeks or months of normal development, which appear as a progressive decline in head growth, weak or stiffened muscles (spasticity), and cognitive and developmental delays that range from moderate to severe. symptoms last for several months, and include irritability, inconsolable crying, intermittent fever, seizures, and loss of developmental skills. children may also have puffy swelling on the fingers, toes, and ears that resemble chilblains. a number of children have a noticeable startle reaction to sudden noise. for babies with the later-onset form, as symptoms lessen, there is no further worsening of the disease. ags is difficult to diagnose since many of the symptoms are similar to those of other disorders. diagnosis is made based on the clinical symptoms of the disease, as well as characteristic brain abnormalities that can be seen in an mri brain scan. cerebrospinal fluid (csf), taken using a ""spinal tap,"" can also be tested for increased levels of a specific immune system cell (a lymphocyte), which indicates a condition known as chronic lymphocytosis. these cells are normally only elevated during infection, so that lymphocytosis without evidence of infection can be used as an indicator of ags. csf may also be tested for elevated levels of a substance known as interferon-gamma, which can also support a diagnosis of ags. the mutations of four different genes are associated with ags: - aicardi-goutieres syndrome-1 (ags1) and ags5 (an autosomal dominant form) are caused by a mutation in the trex1 gene, - ags2 is caused by a mutation in the rnaseh2b gene, - ags3 is caused by a mutation in the rnaseh2c gene, - ags4 is caused by a mutation in the rnaseh2a gene. most cases of ags are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, which means that both parents of a child with ags must carry a single copy of the defective gene responsible for the disease. parents do not have any symptoms of disease, but with every child they have together, there is a one in four chance that the baby will receive two copies of the defective gene and inherit ags. note: ags is distinct from the similarly named aicardi syndrome (characterized by absence of a brain structure (corpus callosum), and spinal, skeletal, and eye abnormalities)."
what is (are) pinched nerve ?,"the term ""pinched nerve"" is a colloquial term and not a true medical term. it is used to describe one type of damage or injury to a nerve or set of nerves. the injury may result from compression, constriction, or stretching. symptoms include numbness, ""pins and needles"" or burning sensations, and pain radiating outward from the injured area. one of the most common examples of a single compressed nerve is the feeling of having a foot or hand ""fall asleep."" a ""pinched nerve"" frequently is associated with pain in the neck or lower back. this type of pain can be caused by inflammation or pressure on the nerve root as it exits the spine. if the pain is severe or lasts a long time, you may need to have further evaluation from your physician. several problems can lead to similar symptoms of numbness, pain, and tingling in the hands or feet but without pain in the neck or back. these can include peripheral neuropathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, and tennis elbow. the extent of such injuries may vary from minor, temporary damage to a more permanent condition. early diagnosis is important to prevent further damage or complications. pinched nerve is a common cause of on-the-job injury."
what is the outlook for leukodystrophy ?,the prognosis for the leukodystrophies varies according to the specific type of leukodystrophy.
what is the outlook for encephalopathy ?,"treating the underlying cause of the disorder may improve symptoms. however, the encephalopathy may cause permanent structural changes and irreversible damage to the brain. some encephalopathies can be fatal."
what are the treatments for tremor ?,"there is no cure for most tremors. the appropriate treatment depends on accurate diagnosis of the cause. drug treatment for parkinsonian tremor involves levodopa or dopamine-like drugs such as pramipexole and ropinirole. essential tremor may be treated with propranolol or other beta blockers (such as nadolol) and primidone, an anticonvulsant drug. dystonic tremor may respond to clonazepam, anticholinergic drugs, and intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin. eliminating tremor ""triggers"" such as caffeine and other stimulants from the diet is often recommended. physical therapy may help to reduce tremor and improve coordination and muscle control for some individuals. surgical intervention, such as thalamotomy and deep brain stimulation, are usually performed only when the tremor is severe and does not respond to drugs."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for alexander disease ?,"recent discoveries show that most individuals (approximately 90 percent) with alexander disease have a mutation in the gene that makes glial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap). gfap is a normal component of the brain, but it is unclear how the mutations in this genecauses the disease. in most cases mutations occur spontaneously are not inherited from parents.a small number of people thought to have alexander disease do not have identifiable mutations in gfap, which leads researchers to believe that there may be other genetic or perhaps even non-genetic causes of alexander disease. current research is aimed at understanding the mechanisms by which the mutations cause disease, developing better animal models for the disorder, and exploring potential strategies for treatment. at present, there is no exact animal model for the disease; however, mice have been engineered to produce the same mutant forms of gfap found in individuals with alexander disease. these mice form rosenthal fibers and have a predisposition for seizures, but do not yet mimic all features of human disease (such as the leukodystrophies). one clinical study is underway to identify biomarkers of disease severity or progression in samples of blood or cerebrospinal fluid. such biomarkers, if found, would be a major advantage for evaluating the response to any treatments that are developed in the future."
what are the treatments for primary lateral sclerosis ?,"treatment for individuals with pls is symptomatic. muscle relaxants such as baclofen, tizanidine, and the benzodiazepines may reduce spasticity. other drugs may relieve pain and antidepressants can help treat depression. physical therapy, occupational therapy, and rehabilitation may prevent joint immobility and slow muscle weakness and atrophy. assistive devices such as supports or braces, speech synthesizers, and wheelchairs ma help some people retain independence. speech therapy may be useful for those with involvement of the facial muscles."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for coffin lowry syndrome ?,"the ninds supports and conducts research on genetic disorders, such as coffin-lowry syndrome, in an effort to find ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure these disorders."
what are the treatments for multi-infarct dementia ?,"there is no treatment available to reverse brain damage that has been caused by a stroke. treatment focuses on preventing future strokes by controlling or avoiding the diseases and medical conditions that put people at high risk for stroke: high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, and cardiovascular disease. the best treatment for mid is prevention early in life eating a healthy diet, exercising, not smoking, moderately using alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for porencephaly ?,the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) and other institutes of the national institutes of health (nih) conduct research related to porencephaly in laboratories at the nih and also support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. much of this research explores the complex mechanisms of normal brain development. the knowledge gained from these fundamental studies will provide a foundation for developing ways to prevent porecephaly and the other cephalic disorders.
what is the outlook for megalencephaly ?,the prognosis for infants and children with megalencephaly depends upon the underlying cause and the associated neurological disorders. the prognosis for children with hemimegalencephaly is poor.
what are the treatments for joubert syndrome ?,"treatment for joubert syndrome is symptomatic and supportive. infant stimulation and physical, occupational, and speech therapy may benefit some children. infants with abnormal breathing patterns should be monitored. screening for progressive eye, liver, and kidney complications associated with joubert-related disorders should be performed on a regular basis."
what is the outlook for vasculitis syndromes of the central and peripheral nervous systems ?,"the prognosis is dependent upon the specific syndrome, however, some of the syndromes are fatal if left untreated."
what is the outlook for repetitive motion disorders ?,"most individuals with rmds recover completely and can avoid re-injury by changing the way they perform repetitive movements, the frequency with which they perform them, and the amount of time they rest between movements. without treatment, rmds may result in permanent injury and complete loss of function in the affected area."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for repetitive motion disorders ?,much of the on-going research on rmds is aimed at prevention and rehabilitation. the national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases (niams) funds research on rmds.
what is (are) lennox-gastaut syndrome ?,"lennox-gastaut syndrome is a severe form of epilepsy. seizures usually begin before 4 years of age. seizure types, which vary among patients, include tonic (stiffening of the body, upward deviation of the eyes, dilation of the pupils, and altered respiratory patterns), atonic (brief loss of muscle tone and consciousness, causing abrupt falls), atypical absence (staring spells), and myoclonic (sudden muscle jerks). there may be periods of frequent seizures mixed with brief, relatively seizure-free periods. most children with lennox-gastaut syndrome experience some degree of impaired intellectual functioning or information processing, along with developmental delays, and behavioral disturbances. lennox-gastaut syndrome can be caused by brain malformations, perinatal asphyxia, severe head injury, central nervous system infection and inherited degenerative or metabolic conditions. in 30-35 percent of cases, no cause can be found."
what is (are) guillain-barr syndrome ?,"guillain-barr syndrome is a disorder in which the body's immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system. the first symptoms of this disorder include varying degrees of weakness or tingling sensations in the legs. in many instances, the weakness and abnormal sensations spread to the arms and upper body. these symptoms can increase in intensity until the muscles cannot be used at all and the person is almost totally paralyzed. in these cases, the disorder is life-threatening and is considered a medical emergency. the individual is often put on a ventilator to assist with breathing. most individuals, however, have good recovery from even the most severe cases of guillain-barr syndrome (gbs), although some continue to have some degree of weakness. guillain-barr syndrome is rare. usually guillain-barr occurs a few days or weeks after the person has had symptoms of a respiratory or gastrointestinal viral infection. occasionally, surgery will trigger the syndrome. in rare instances, vaccinations may increase the risk of gbs. the disorder can develop over the course of hours or days, or it may take up to 3 to 4 weeks. no one yet knows why guillain-barr strikes some people and not others or what sets the disease in motion. what scientists do know is that the body's immune system begins to attack the body itself, causing what is known as an autoimmune disease. guillain-barr is called a syndrome rather than a disease because it is not clear that a specific disease-causing agent is involved. reflexes such as knee jerks are usually lost. because the signals traveling along the nerve are slower, a nerve conduction velocity (ncv) test can give a doctor clues to aid the diagnosis. the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the spinal cord and brain contains more protein than usual, so a physician may decide to perform a spinal tap."
what are the treatments for guillain-barr syndrome ?,"there is no known cure for guillain-barr syndrome, but therapies can lessen the severity of the illness and accelerate the recovery in most patients. there are also a number of ways to treat the complications of the disease. currently, plasmapheresis (also known as plasma exchange) and high-dose immunoglobulin therapy are used. plasmapheresis seems to reduce the severity and duration of the guillain-barr episode. in high-dose immunoglobulin therapy, doctors give intravenous injections of the proteins that in small quantities, the immune system uses naturally to attack invading organism. investigators have found that giving high doses of these immunoglobulins, derived from a pool of thousands of normal donors, to guillain-barr patients can lessen the immune attack on the nervous system. the most critical part of the treatment for this syndrome consists of keeping the patient's body functioning during recovery of the nervous system. this can sometimes require placing the patient on a ventilator, a heart monitor, or other machines that assist body function."
what are the treatments for isaacs' syndrome ?,"anticonvulsants, including phenytoin and carbamazepine, usually provide significant relief from the stiffness, muscle spasms, and pain associated with isaacs' syndrome. plasma exchange may provide short-term relief for individuals with some forms of the acquired disorder."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for agnosia ?,the ninds supports research on disorders of the brain such as agnosia with the goal of finding ways to prevent or cure them.
what is (are) rett syndrome ?,"rett syndrome is a childhood neurodevelopmental disorder that affects females almost exclusively. the child generally appears to grow and develop normally, before symptoms begin. loss of muscle tone is usually the first symptom. other early symptoms may include a slowing of development, problems crawling or walking, and diminished eye contact. as the syndrome progresses, a child will lose purposeful use of her hands and the ability to speak. compulsive hand movements such as wringing and washing follow the loss of functional use of the hands. the inability to perform motor functions is perhaps the most severely disabling feature of rett syndrome, interfering with every body movement, including eye gaze and speech."
what is the outlook for sydenham chorea ?,"most children recover completely from sd, although a small number will continue to have disabling, persistent chorea despite treatment. the duration of symptoms varies, generally from 3 to 6 weeks, but some children will have symptoms for several months. cardiac complications may occur in a small minority of children, usually in the form of endocarditis. in a third of the children with the disease, sd will recur, typically 1 to 2 years after the initial attack. researchers have noted an association between recurrent sd and the later development of the abrupt onset forms of obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, tic disorders, and autism, which they call pandas, for pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus infection. further studies are needed to determine the nature of the association and the biological pathways that connect streptococcal infection, autoimmune response, and the later development of these specific behavioral disorders."
what is (are) antiphospholipid syndrome ?,"antiphospholipid syndrome (aps) is an autoimmune disorder caused when antibodies -- immune system cells that fight off bacteria and viruses -- mistakenly attack healthy body tissues and organs. in aps, specific antibodies activate the inner lining of blood vessels, which leads to the formation of blood clots in arteries or veins. aps is sometimes called sticky blood syndrome, because of the increased tendency to form blood clots in the veins and arteries. the symptoms of aps are due to the abnormal blood clotting. clots can develop in the veins of the legs and lungs, or in the placenta of pregnant women. one of the most serious complications of aps occurs when a clot forms in the brain and causes a stroke. other neurological symptoms include chronic headaches, dementia (similar to the dementia of alzheimers disease), and seizures. infrequently, individuals will develop chorea (a movement disorder in which the body and limbs writhe uncontrollably), cognitive dysfunction (such as poor memory), transverse myelitis, depression or psychosis, optic neuropathy, or sudden hearing loss. in pregnant women, clots in the placenta can cause miscarriages. aps is diagnosed by the presence of a positive antiphospholipid antibody and either a history of blood clots in an artery or vein or a history of multiple miscarriages or other pregnancy problems. some individuals will have a characteristic lacy, net-like red rash called livedo reticularis over their wrists and knees."
what are the complications of machado-joseph disease ?,"lyme disease is caused by a bacterial organism that is transmitted to humans via the bite of an infected tick. most people with lyme disease develop a characteristic skin rash around the area of the bite. the rash may feel hot to the touch, and vary in size, shape, and color, but it will often have a ""bull's eye"" appearance (a red ring with a clear center). however, there are those who will not develop the rash, which can make lyme disease hard to diagnose because its symptoms and signs mimic those of many other diseases. anywhere from 7 to 14 days (or in some cases, 30 days) following an infected tick's bite, the first stage of lyme disease may begin with flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, fatigue, muscle aches, and joint pain. neurological complications most often occur in the second stage of lyme disease, with numbness, pain, weakness, bell's palsy (paralysis of the facial muscles), visual disturbances, and meningitis symptoms such as fever, stiff neck, and severe headache. other problems, which may not appear until weeks, months, or years after a tick bite, include decreased concentration, irritability, memory and sleep disorders, and nerve damage in the arms and legs."
what is (are) progressive supranuclear palsy ?,"progressive supranuclear palsy (psp) is a rare brain disorder that causes serious and progressive problems with control of gait and balance, along with complex eye movement and thinking problems. one of the classic signs of the disease is an inability to aim the eyes properly, which occurs because of lesions in the area of the brain that coordinates eye movements. some individuals describe this effect as a blurring. affected individualsoften show alterations of mood and behavior, including depression and apathy as well as progressive mild dementia. the disorder's long name indicates that the disease begins slowly and continues to get worse (progressive), and causes weakness (palsy) by damaging certain parts of the brain above pea-sized structures called nuclei that control eye movements (supranuclear). psp was first described as a distinct disorder in 1964, when three scientists published a paper that distinguished the condition from parkinson's disease. it is sometimes referred to as steele-richardson-olszewski syndrome, reflecting the combined names of the scientists who defined the disorder. although psp gets progressively worse, no one dies from psp itself."
what is the outlook for tardive dyskinesia ?,"symptoms of tardive dyskinesia may remain long after discontinuation of neuroleptic drugs. in many cases, the symptoms stop spontaneously, but in some cases they may persist indefinitely."
what is (are) klippel feil syndrome ?,"klippel-feil syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by the congenital fusion of two or more cervical (neck) vertebrae. it is caused by a failure in the normal segmentation or division of the cervical vertebrae during the early weeks of fetal development. the most common signs of the disorder are short neck, low hairline at the back of the head, and restricted mobility of the upper spine. the fused vertebrae can cause nerve damage and pain in the head, neck, or back. associated abnormalities may include scoliosis (curvature of the spine), spina bifida (a birth defect of the spine), cleft palate, respiratory problems, and heart malformations. other features may include joint pain; anomalies of the head and face, skeleton, sex organs, muscles, brain and spinal cord, arms, legs, and fingers; and difficulties hearing. most cases are sporadic (happen on their own) but mutations in the gdf6 (growth differentiation factor 6) or gdf3 (growth differentiation factor 3) genes can cause the disorder. these genes make proteins that are involved in bone development and segmentation of the vertebrae."
what are the treatments for klippel feil syndrome ?,"treatment for klippel-feil syndrome is symptomatic and may include surgery to relieve cervical or craniocervical instability and constriction of the spinal cord, and to correct scoliosis. physical therapy may also be useful."
what are the treatments for melkersson-rosenthal syndrome ?,"treatment is symptomatic and may include medication therapies with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) and corticosteroids to reduce swelling, as well as antibiotics and immunosuppressants. surgery may be recommended to relieve pressure on the facial nerves and to reduce swollen tissue, but its effectiveness has not been established. massage and electrical stimulation may also be prescribed."
what is the outlook for wernicke-korsakoff syndrome ?,"most symptoms of wernicke's encephalopathy can be reversed if detected and treated promptly and completely. stopping alcohol use may prevent further nerve and brain damage. however, improvement in memory function is slow and, usually, incomplete. without treatment, these disorders can be disabling and life-threatening."
what is (are) klippel-trenaunay syndrome (kts) ?,"klippel-trenaunay syndrome (kts) is a rare congenital malformation involving blood and lymph vessels and abnormal growth of soft and bone tissue. typical symptoms include hemangiomas (abnormal benign growths on the skin consisting of masses of blood vessels) and varicose veins. fused toes or fingers, or extra toes or fingers, may be present. in some cases, internal bleeding may occur as a result of blood vessel malformations involving organs such as the stomach, rectum, vagina, liver, spleen, bladder, kidneys, lungs, or heart. individuals are also at risk for blood clots. the cause of the disorder is unknown. a similar port-wine stain disorder in which individuals have vascular anomalies on the face as well as in the brain is sturge-weber syndrome. these individuals may experience seizures and mental deficiency. in some cases, features of the klippel-trenaunay syndrome and sturge-weber syndrome coincide. another overlapping condition is the parkes-weber syndrome, which is characterized by abnormal connectivity between the arterial and venous system (arteriovenous fistulas)."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for klippel-trenaunay syndrome (kts) ?,the ninds supports research on congenital disorders such as kts with the goal of finding new means to treat and prevent them.
what is the outlook for hydrocephalus ?,"the prognosis for individuals diagnosed with hydrocephalus is difficult to predict, although there is some correlation between the specific cause of hydrocephalus and the patient's outcome. prognosis is further complicated by the presence of associated disorders, the timeliness of diagnosis, and the success of treatment. the symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus usually get worse over time if the condition is not treated, although some people may experience temporary improvements. if left untreated, progressive hydrocephalus is fatal, with rare exceptions. the parents of children with hydrocephalus should be aware that hydrocephalus poses risks to both cognitive and physical development. treatment by an interdisciplinary team of medical professionals, rehabilitation specialists, and educational experts is critical to a positive outcome. many children diagnosed with the disorder benefit from rehabilitation therapies and educational interventions, and go on to lead normal lives with few limitations."
what is the outlook for mucopolysaccharidoses ?,"the mucopolysaccharidoses syndromes share many clinical features but have varying degrees of severity. most individuals with a mucopolysaccharidosis syndrome generally experience a period of normal development followed by a decline in physical and mental function. longevity is dependent upon the particular syndrome. for example, children with a form of mucopolysaccharidosis called hurler syndrome often die before age 10 from obstructive airway disease, respiratory infections, or cardiac complications. a child with the type known as scheie syndrome can live into adulthood, while one with a mild case of the type known as hunter syndrome may live into his or her 50s or beyond."
what are the treatments for iniencephaly ?,"there is no standard treatment for iniencephaly since most infants rarely live longer than a few hours. medicine is based more on prevention using supplementation with folic acid. numerous studies have demonstrated that mothers can reduce the risk of neural tube birth defects such as iniencephaly by up to 70 percent with daily supplements of at least 4 mg of folic acid. pregnant women should avoid taking antiepileptic drugs, diuretics, antihistamines, and sulfa drugs, which have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects. maternal obesity and diabetes are also known to increase the risk for these disorders."
what is (are) multiple sclerosis ?,"an unpredictable disease of the central nervous system, multiple sclerosis (ms) can range from relatively benign to somewhat disabling to devastating, as communication between the brain and other parts of the body is disrupted. many investigators believe ms to be an autoimmune disease -- one in which the body, through its immune system, launches a defensive attack against its own tissues. in the case of ms, it is the nerve-insulating myelin that comes under assault. such assaults may be linked to an unknown environmental trigger, perhaps a virus. most people experience their first symptoms of ms between the ages of 20 and 40; the initial symptom of ms is often blurred or double vision, red-green color distortion, or even blindness in one eye. most ms patients experience muscle weakness in their extremities and difficulty with coordination and balance. these symptoms may be severe enough to impair walking or even standing. in the worst cases, ms can produce partial or complete paralysis. most people with ms also exhibit paresthesias, transitory abnormal sensory feelings such as numbness, prickling, or ""pins and needles"" sensations. some may also experience pain. speech impediments, tremors, and dizziness are other frequent complaints. occasionally, people with ms have hearing loss. approximately half of all people with ms experience cognitive impairments such as difficulties with concentration, attention, memory, and poor judgment, but such symptoms are usually mild and are frequently overlooked. depression is another common feature of ms."
what is the outlook for aicardi syndrome ?,"the prognosis for girls with aicardi syndrome varies according to the severity of their symptoms. there is an increased risk for death in childhood and adolescence, but survivors into adulthood have been described."
what is (are) holoprosencephaly ?,"holoprosencephaly is a disorder caused by the failure of the prosencephalon (the embryonic forebrain) to sufficiently divide into the double lobes of the cerebral hemispheres. the result is a single-lobed brain structure and severe skull and facial defects. in most cases of holoprosencephaly, the malformations are so severe that babies die before birth. in less severe cases, babies are born with normal or near-normal brain development and facial deformities that may affect the eyes, nose, and upper lip. there are three classifications of holoprosencephaly. alobar, in which the brain has not divided at all, is usually associated with severe facial deformities. semilobar, in which the brain's hemispheres have somewhat divided, causes an intermediate form of the disorder. lobar, in which there is considerable evidence of separate brain hemispheres, is the least severe form. in some cases of lobar holoprosencephaly the baby's brain may be nearly normal. the least severe of the facial anomalies is the median cleft lip (premaxillary agenesis). the most severe is cyclopia, an abnormality characterized by a single eye located in the area normally occupied by the root of the nose, and a missing nose or a proboscis (a tubular-shaped nose) located above the eye. the least common facial anomaly is ethmocephaly, in which a proboscis separates closely-set eyes. cebocephaly, another facial anomaly, is characterized by a small, flattened nose with a single nostril situated below incomplete or underdeveloped closely-set eyes."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for holoprosencephaly ?,"the ninds supports and conducts a wide range of studies that focus on identifying and learning more about the factors involved in normal brain development. recent research has identified specific genes that cause holoprosencephaly. the knowledge gained from these fundamental studies provides the foundation for understanding how to develop new ways to treat, and potentially prevent, this disorder."
what is the outlook for neurosarcoidosis ?,"the prognosis for patients with neurosarcoidosis varies. approximately two-thirds of those with the condition will recover completely; the remainder will have a chronically progressing or on-and-off course of illness. complications resulting from immunosuppressive treatments, such as cryptococcal and tuberculous meningitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and inclusion body myositis, may be fatal for a small percentage of individuals."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for pituitary tumors ?,"the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) and other institutes of the national institutes of health (nih) conduct research related to brain tumors, including pituitary tumors, in their laboratories at the nih and also support research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure pituitary tumors."
what is (are) neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation ?,"neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (nbia) is a rare, inherited, neurological movement disorder characterized by an abnormal accumulation of iron in the brain and progressive degeneration of the nervous system. symptoms, which vary greatly among patients and usually develop during childhood, may include dystonia (slow writhing, distorting muscle contractions of the limbs, face, or trunk), dysarthria (slurred or slow speech) choreoathetosis (involuntary, purposeless jerky muscle movements), muscle rigidity (uncontrolled tightness of the muscles), spasticity (sudden, involuntary muscle spasms), and/or ataxia (inability to coordinate movements), confusion, disorientation, seizures, stupor, and dementia. visual changes are also common, most often due to atrophy of the optic nerve (optic atrophy) or degeneration of the retinal layer in the back of the eye (retinal degeneration cognitive decline occurs in some forms of nbia; the majority of individuals with nbia do not have cognitive impairment. several genes have been found that cause nbia."
what is (are) neuroaxonal dystrophy ?,"infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (inad) is a rare inherited neurological disorder. it affects axons, the part of a nerve cell that carries messages from the brain to other parts of the body, and causes progressive loss of vision, muscular control, and mental skills. while the basic genetic and metabolic causes are unknown, inad is the result of an abnormal build-up of toxic substances in nerves that communicate with muscles, skin, and the conjunctive tissue around the eyes. symptoms usually begin within the first 2 years of life, with the loss of head control and the ability to sit, crawl, or walk, accompanied by deterioration in vision and speech. some children may have seizures. distinctive facial deformities may be present at birth, including a prominent forehead, crossed eyes, an unusually small nose or jaw, and large, low-set ears. inad is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that both parents must be carriers of the defective gene that causes inad to pass it on to their child. electrophysiology (nerve conduction velocities) may be helpful for diagnosis, although diagnosis is usually confirmed by tissue biopsy of skin, rectum, nerve or conjunctive tissue to confirm the presence of characteristic swellings (spheroid bodies) in the nerve axons."
what are the treatments for inclusion body myositis ?,"there is no cure for ibm, nor is there a standard course of treatment. the disease is generally unresponsive to corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs. some evidence suggests that intravenous immunoglobulin may have a slight, but short-lasting, beneficial effect in a small number of cases. physical therapy may be helpful in maintaining mobility. other therapy is symptomatic and supportive."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for inclusion body myositis ?,"the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds), national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases (niams), national institute of environmental health sciences (niehs) and other institutes of the national institutes of health (nih) conduct research relating to ibm in laboratories at the nih and support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. currently funded research is exploring patterns of gene expression among the inflammatory myopathies, the role of viral infection as a precursor to the disorders, and the safety and efficacy of various treatment regimens."
what is the outlook for mucolipidoses ?,"symptoms of ml can be congenital (present at birth) or begin in early childhood or adolescence. early symptoms can include skeletal abnormalities, vision problems and developmental delays. over time, many children with ml develop poor mental capacities, have difficulty reaching normal developmental milestones, and, in many cases, eventually die of the disease."
what is (are) trigeminal neuralgia ?,"trigeminal neuralgia (tn), also called tic douloureux, is a chronic pain condition that causes extreme, sporadic, sudden burning or shock-like face pain. the painseldomlasts more than a few seconds or a minute or twoper episode. the intensity of pain can be physically and mentally incapacitating. tn pain is typically felt on one side of the jaw or cheek. episodes can last for days, weeks, or months at a time and then disappear for months or years. in the days before an episode begins, some patients may experience a tingling or numbing sensation or a somewhat constant and aching pain. the attacks often worsen over time, with fewer and shorter pain-free periods before they recur. the intense flashes of pain can be triggered by vibration or contact with the cheek (such as when shaving, washing the face, or applying makeup), brushing teeth, eating, drinking, talking, or being exposed to the wind. tn occurs most often in people over age 50, but it can occur at any age, and is more common in women than in men. there is some evidence that the disorder runs in families, perhaps because of an inherited pattern of blood vessel formation. although sometimes debilitating, the disorder is not life-threatening. the presumed cause of tn is a blood vessel pressing on the trigeminal nerve in the head as it exits the brainstem. tn may be part of the normal aging process but in some cases it is the associated with another disorder, such as multiple sclerosis or other disorders characterized by damage to the myelin sheath that covers certain nerves."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for trigeminal neuralgia ?,"within the ninds research programs, trigeminal neuralgia is addressed primarily through studies associated with pain research. ninds vigorously pursues a research program seeking new treatments for pain and nerve damage with the ultimate goal of reversing debilitating conditions such as trigeminal neuralgia. ninds has notified research investigators that it is seeking grant applications both in basic and clinical pain research."
what is (are) subacute sclerosing panencephalitis ?,"subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) is a progressive neurological disorder of children and young adults that affects the central nervous system (cns). it is a slow, but persistent, viral infection caused by defective measles virus. sspe has been reported from all parts of the world, but it is considered a rare disease in developed countries, with fewer than 10 cases per year reported in the united states. the incidence of sspe declined by at least 90 percent in countries that have practiced widespread immunization with measles vaccine. the incidence of sspe is still high in developing countries such as india and eastern europe. there is a higher incidence among males than females (male/female: 3/1). most youngsters with sspe have a history of measles infection at an early age, usually younger than 2 years, followed by a latent period of 6 to 8 years before neurological symptoms begin. despite the long interval between the measles infection and the onset of sspe, researchers think that the infection of the brain occurs soon after the primary bout with measles and progresses slowly. why it persists and progresses still isn't clear. the initial symptoms of sspe are subtle and include mild mental deterioration (such as memory loss) and changes in behavior (such as irritability) followed by disturbances in motor function, including uncontrollable involuntary jerking movements of the head, trunk or limbs called myoclonic jerks. seizures may also occur. some people may become blind. in advanced stages of the disease, individuals may lose the ability to walk, as their muscles stiffen or spasm. there is progressive deterioration to a comatose state, and then to a persistent vegetative state. death is usually the result of fever, heart failure, or the brain's inability to continue controlling the autonomic nervous system."
what is the outlook for subacute sclerosing panencephalitis ?,"most individuals with sspe will die within 1 to 3 years of diagnosis. in a small percentage of people, the disease will progress rapidly, leading to death over a short course within three months of diagnosis. another small group will have a chronic, slowly progressive form, some with relapses and remissions. a very small number (approximately 5 percent) may experience spontaneous long term improvement and regain lost function. prevention, in the form of measles vaccination, is the only real ""cure"" for sspe."
what is (are) back pain ?,"acute or short-term low back pain generally lasts from a few days to a few weeks. most acute back pain is the result of trauma to the lower back or a disorder such as arthritis. pain from trauma may be caused by a sports injury, work around the house or in the garden, or a sudden jolt such as a car accident or other stress on spinal bones and tissues. symptoms may range from muscle ache to shooting or stabbing pain, limited flexibility and range of motion, or an inability to stand straight. chronic back pain is pain that persists for more than 3 months. it is often progressive and the cause can be difficult to determine."
what is the outlook for coma ?,"the outcome for coma and persistent vegetative state depends on the cause, severity, and site of neurological damage. individuals may emerge from coma with a combination of physical, intellectual, and psychological difficulties that need special attention. recovery usually occurs gradually, with some acquiring more and more ability to respond. some individuals never progress beyond very basic responses, but many recover full awareness. individuals recovering from coma require close medical supervision. a coma rarely lasts more than 2 to 4 weeks. some patients may regain a degree of awareness after persistent vegetative state. others may remain in that state for years or even decades. the most common cause of death for someone in a persistent vegetative state is infection, such as pneumonia."
what are the treatments for neuronal migration disorders ?,"treatment is symptomatic, and may include anti-seizure medication and special or supplemental education consisting of physical, occupational, and speech therapies."
what is the outlook for neuronal migration disorders ?,the prognosis for children with nmds varies depending on the specific disorder and the degree of brain abnormality and subsequent neurological signs and symptoms.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for neurological complications of aids ?,"within the federal government, the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds), one part of the national institutes of health (nih), supports research on the neurological consequences of aids. the ninds works closely with its sister agency, the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid), which has primary responsibility for research related to hiv and aids."
what are the treatments for creutzfeldt-jakob disease ?,"there is no treatment that can cure or control cjd, although studies of a variety of drugs are now in progress. current treatment is aimed at alleviating symptoms and making the person as comfortable as possible. opiate drugs can help relieve pain, and the drugs clonazepam and sodium valproate may help relieve involuntary muscle jerks.intravenous fluids and artificial feeding may be needed in later stages of the disease."
what is (are) giant axonal neuropathy ?,"giant axonal neuropathy (gan) is a rare inherited genetic disorder that affects both the central and peripheral nervous systems. the majority of children with gan will begin to show symptoms of the disease sometime before five years of age. signs of gan usually begin in the peripheral nervous system, which controls movement and sensation in the arms, legs, and other parts of the body. the typical symptoms of gan are clumsiness and muscle weakness that progresses from a waddling gait to a pronounced difficulty in walking. additional symptoms include numbness or lack of feeling in the arms and legs, seizures, nystagmus (rapid back and forth movement of the eyes), and impaired cognitive development. a characteristic sign of the disease is dull, tightly curled hair that is markedly different from the parents in color and texture. researchers have discovered more than 20 different mutations associated with gan in a gene, gan1, which makes a protein called gigaxonin. these mutations disrupt the regulation or production of gigaxonin in the nervous system. as a result, axons, which are the long tails of neurons that allow them to communicate with other nerve cells, swell up with tangled filaments and become abnormally large. eventually these axons deteriorate and cause problems with movement and sensation since neurons are no longer able to communicate with each other. doctors diagnose gan by using several tests, including one that measures nerve conduction velocity, a brain mri, and a peripheral nerve biopsy (in which a bit of tissue from a peripheral nerve is removed and examined to look for swollen axons). a definitive diagnosis using genetic testing is available on a research basis only. gan is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means that both parents of a child with gan have to carry a copy of the mutated gene. parents, typically, will show no signs of the disease."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for giant axonal neuropathy ?,"the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) supports research related to gan through grants to major medical institutions across the country. much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure inherited neurological disorders such as gan."
what are the treatments for ataxia telangiectasia ?,"there is no cure for a-t and, currently, no way to slow the progression of the disease. treatment is symptomatic and supportive. physical and occupational therapy help to maintain flexibility. speech therapy is important, teaching children to control air flow to the vocal cords. gamma-globulin injections may be useful if immunoglobulin levels are sufficiently reduced to weaken the immune system. high-dose vitamin regimens and antioxidants such as alpha lipoic acid also may also be used."
what is (are) central pontine myelinolysis ?,"central pontine myelinolysis (cpm) is a neurological disorder that most frequently occurs after too rapid medical correction of sodium deficiency (hyponatremia). the rapid rise in sodium concentration is accompanied by the movement of small molecules and pulls water from brain cells. through a mechanism that is only partly understood, the shift in water and brain molecules leads to the destruction of myelin, a substance that surrounds and protects nerve fibers. nerve cells (neurons) can also be damaged. certain areas of the brain are particularly susceptible to myelinolysis, especially the part of the brain stem called the pons. some individuals will also have damage in other areas of the brain, which is called extrapontine myelinolysis (epm). experts estimate that 10 percent of those with cpm will also have areas of epm. the initial symptoms of myelinolysis, which begin to appear 2 to 3 days after hyponatremia is corrected, include a depressed level of awareness, difficulty speaking (dysarthria or mutism), and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). additional symptoms often arise over the next 1-2 weeks, including impaired thinking, weakness or paralysis in the arms and legs, stiffness, impaired sensation, and difficulty with coordination. at its most severe, myelinolysis can lead to coma, locked-in syndrome (which is the complete paralysis of all of the voluntary muscles in the body except for those that control the eyes), and death. although many affected people improve over weeks to months, some have permanent disability. some also develop new symptoms later, including behavioral or intellectual impairment or movement disorders like parkinsonism or tremor. anyone, including adults and children, who undergoes a rapid rise in serum sodium is at risk for myelinolysis. some individuals who are particularly vulnerable are those with chronic alcoholism and those who have had a liver transplant. myelinolysis has occurred in individuals undergoing renal dialysis, burn victims, people with hiv-aids, people over-using water loss pills (diuretics), and women with eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia. the risk for cpm is greater if the serum (blood) sodium was low for at least 2 days before correction."
what are the treatments for central pontine myelinolysis ?,"the ideal treatment for myelinolysis is to prevent the disorder by identifying individuals at risk and following careful guidelines for evaluation and correction of hyponatremia. these guidelines aim to safely restore the serum sodium level, while protecting the brain. for those who have hyponatremia for at least 2 days, or for whom the duration is not known, the rate of rise in the serum sodium concentration should be kept below 10 mmol/l during any 24-hour period, if possible. for those who develop myelinolysis, treatment is supportive. some physicians have tried to treat myelinolysis with steroid medication or other experimental therapies, but none has been proven effective. individuals are likely to require extensive and prolonged physical therapy and rehabilitation. those individuals who develop parkinsonian symptoms may respond to the dopaminergic drugs that work for individuals with parkinsons disease."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for prosopagnosia ?,"the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) conducts research related to prosopagnosia in its laboratories at the national institutes of health (nih), and also supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure disorders, such as prosopagnosia."
what is (are) lesch-nyhan syndrome ?,"lesch-nyhan syndrome (lns) is a rare, inherited disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt). lns is an x-linked recessive disease-- the gene is carried by the mother and passed on to her son. lns is present at birth in baby boys. the lack of hprt causes a build-up of uric acid in all body fluids, and leads to symptoms such as severe gout, poor muscle control, and moderate retardation, which appear in the first year of life. a striking feature of lns is self-mutilating behaviors characterized by lip and finger biting that begin in the second year of life. abnormally high uric acid levels can cause sodium urate crystals to form in the joints, kidneys, central nervous system, and other tissues of the body, leading to gout-like swelling in the joints and severe kidney problems. neurological symptoms include facial grimacing, involuntary writhing, and repetitive movements of the arms and legs similar to those seen in huntingtons disease. because a lack of hprt causes the body to poorly utilize vitamin b12, some boys may develop a rare disorder called megaloblastic anemia."
what are the treatments for lesch-nyhan syndrome ?,"treatment for lns is symptomatic. gout can be treated with allopurinol to control excessive amounts of uric acid. kidney stones may be treated with lithotripsy, a technique for breaking up kidney stones using shock waves or laser beams. there is no standard treatment for the neurological symptoms of lns. some may be relieved with the drugs carbidopa/levodopa, diazepam, phenobarbital, or haloperidol."
what is the outlook for lesch-nyhan syndrome ?,the prognosis for individuals with lns is poor. death is usually due to renal failure in the first or second decade of life.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for lesch-nyhan syndrome ?,the gene associated with lns is known. the ninds supports and conducts research on genetic disorders such as lns in an effort to find ways to prevent and treat these disorders.

what is (are) lambert-eaton myasthenic syndrome ?,"lambert-eaton myasthenic syndrome (lems) is a disorder of the neuromuscular junction-the site where nerve cells meet muscle cells and help activate the muscles. it is caused by a disruption of electrical impulses between these nerve and muscle cells. lems is an autoimmune condition; in such disorders the immune system, which normally protects the body from foreign organisms, mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues. the disruption of electrical impulses is associated with antibodies produced as a consequence of this autoimmunity. symptoms include muscle weakness, a tingling sensation in the affected areas, fatigue, and dry mouth. lems is closely associated with cancer, in particular small cell lung cancer. more than half the individuals diagnosed with lems also develop small cell lung cancer. lems may appear up to 3 years before cancer is diagnosed."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for lambert-eaton myasthenic syndrome ?,"the ninds supports research on neuromuscular disorders such as lems with the ultimate goal of finding ways to treat, prevent, and cure them."
what is (are) cerebral arteriosclerosis ?,"cerebral arteriosclerosis is the result of thickening and hardening of the walls of the arteries in the brain. symptoms of cerebral arteriosclerosis include headache, facial pain, and impaired vision. cerebral arteriosclerosis can cause serious health problems. if the walls of an artery are too thick, or a blood clot becomes caught in the narrow passage, blood flow to the brain can become blocked and cause an ischemic stroke. when the thickening and hardening is uneven, arterial walls can develop bulges (called aneurysms). if a bulge ruptures, bleeding in the brain can cause a hemorrhagic stroke. both types of stroke can be fatal. cerebral arteriosclerosis is also related to a condition known as vascular dementia, in which small, symptom-free strokes cause cumulative damage and death to neurons (nerve cells) in the brain. personality changes in the elderly, such as apathy, weeping, transient befuddlement, or irritability, might indicate that cerebral arteriosclerosis is present in the brain. computer tomography (ct) and magnetic resonance imaging (mri) of the brain can help reveal the presence of cerebral arteriosclerosis before ischemic strokes, hemorrhagic strokes, or vascular dementia develop."
what is the outlook for neuroacanthocytosis ?,"neuroacanthocytosis is a progressive disease, and in some cases may be complicated by poor nutritional status, cardiac abnormalities, and pneumonia."

what is the outlook for dandy-walker syndrome ?,"the effect of dandy-walker syndrome on intellectual development is variable, with some children having normal cognition and others never achieving normal intellectual development even when the excess fluid buildup is treated early and correctly. longevity depends on the severity of the syndrome and associated malformations. the presence of multiple congenital defects may shorten life span."
what is (are) atrial fibrillation and stroke ?,"atrial fibrillation (af) describes the rapid, irregular beating of the left atrium (upper chamber) of the heart. these rapid contractions of the heart are weaker than normal contractions, resulting in slow flow of blood in the atrium. the blood pools and becomes sluggish and can result in the formation of blood clots. if a clot leaves the heart and travels to the brain, it can cause a stroke by blocking the flow of blood through cerebral arteries. some people with af have no symptoms, but others may experience a fluttering feeling in the area of the chest above the heart, chest pain, lightheadness or fainting, shortness of breath, and fatigue. af is diagnosed by an electrocardiogram (ecg), a device that records the hearts electrical activity. other tests are often performed to rule out contributing causes, such as high blood pressure, an overactive thyroid gland, heart failure, faulty heart valves, lung disease, and stimulant or alcohol abuse. some people will have no identifiable cause for their af."
what are the genetic changes related to x-linked congenital stationary night blindness ?,"mutations in the nyx and cacna1f genes cause the complete and incomplete forms of x-linked congenital stationary night blindness, respectively. the proteins produced from these genes play critical roles in the retina. within the retina, the nyx and cacna1f proteins are located on the surface of light-detecting cells called photoreceptors. the retina contains two types of photoreceptor cells: rods and cones. rods are needed for vision in low light. cones are needed for vision in bright light, including color vision. the nyx and cacna1f proteins ensure that visual signals are passed from rods and cones to other retinal cells called bipolar cells, which is an essential step in the transmission of visual information from the eyes to the brain. mutations in the nyx or cacna1f gene disrupt the transmission of visual signals between photoreceptors and retinal bipolar cells, which impairs vision. in people with the complete form of x-linked congenital stationary night blindness (resulting from nyx mutations), the function of rods is severely disrupted, while the function of cones is only mildly affected. in people with the incomplete form of the condition (resulting from cacna1f mutations), rods and cones are both affected, although they retain some ability to detect light."
what are the genetic changes related to alagille syndrome ?,"in more than 90 percent of cases, mutations in the jag1 gene cause alagille syndrome. another 7 percent of individuals with alagille syndrome have small deletions of genetic material on chromosome 20 that include the jag1 gene. a few people with alagille syndrome have mutations in a different gene, called notch2. the jag1 and notch2 genes provide instructions for making proteins that fit together to trigger interactions called notch signaling between neighboring cells during embryonic development. this signaling influences how the cells are used to build body structures in the developing embryo. changes in either the jag1 gene or notch2 gene probably disrupt the notch signaling pathway. as a result, errors may occur during development, especially affecting the bile ducts, heart, spinal column, and certain facial features."

what are the genetic changes related to hutchinson-gilford progeria syndrome ?,"mutations in the lmna gene cause hutchinson-gilford progeria syndrome. the lmna gene provides instructions for making a protein called lamin a. this protein plays an important role in determining the shape of the nucleus within cells. it is an essential scaffolding (supporting) component of the nuclear envelope, which is the membrane that surrounds the nucleus. mutations that cause hutchinson-gilford progeria syndrome result in the production of an abnormal version of the lamin a protein. the altered protein makes the nuclear envelope unstable and progressively damages the nucleus, making cells more likely to die prematurely. researchers are working to determine how these changes lead to the characteristic features of hutchinson-gilford progeria syndrome."
what are the genetic changes related to mandibuloacral dysplasia ?,"the two forms of mandibuloacral dysplasia are caused by mutations in different genes. mutations in the lmna gene cause mada, and mutations in the zmpste24 gene cause madb. within cells, these genes are involved in maintaining the structure of the nucleus and may play a role in many cellular processes. the lmna gene provides instructions for making two related proteins, lamin a and lamin c. these proteins act as scaffolding (supporting) components of the nuclear envelope, which is the membrane that surrounds the nucleus in cells. the nuclear envelope regulates the movement of molecules into and out of the nucleus and may help regulate the activity of certain genes. mutations in this gene likely change the structure of lamin a and lamin c. the lamin a protein (but not lamin c) must be processed within the cell before becoming part of the nuclear envelope. the protein produced from the zmpste24 gene is involved in this processing; it cuts the immature lamin a protein (prelamin a) at a particular location, forming mature lamin a. mutations in the zmpste24 gene lead to a buildup of prelamin a and a shortage of the mature protein. mutations in the lmna or zmpste24 gene likely disrupt the structure of the nuclear envelope. researchers are working to understand how these genetic changes result in the signs and symptoms of mandibuloacral dysplasia."
what are the genetic changes related to sporadic hemiplegic migraine ?,"mutations in the atp1a2 and cacna1a genes have been found to cause sporadic hemiplegic migraine. the proteins produced from these genes transport charged atoms (ions) across cell membranes. the movement of these ions is critical for normal signaling between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and other parts of the nervous system. signaling between neurons relies on chemicals called neurotransmitters, which are released from one neuron and taken up by neighboring neurons. mutations in the atp1a2 and cacna1a genes disrupt the transport of ions in neurons, which is thought to impair the normal release and uptake of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. the resulting abnormal signaling may lead to the severe headaches and auras characteristic of sporadic hemiplegic migraine. many people with sporadic hemiplegic migraine do not have a mutation in one of the known genes. researchers believe that mutations in other genes are also involved in the condition, although these genes have not been identified. there is little evidence that mutations in the cacna1a and atp1a2 genes play a role in common migraines, which affect millions of people each year. researchers are searching for additional genetic changes that may underlie rare types of migraine, such as sporadic hemiplegic migraine, as well as the more common forms of migraine."

what are the genetic changes related to dilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia syndrome ?,"mutations in the dnajc19 gene cause dcma syndrome. the dnajc19 gene provides instructions for making a protein found in structures called mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers of cells. while the exact function of the dnajc19 protein is unclear, it may regulate the transport of other proteins into and out of mitochondria. the dnajc19 gene mutations that cause dcma syndrome lead to the production of an abnormally shortened protein that likely has impaired function. researchers speculate that a lack of functional dnajc19 protein alters the transport of other proteins into and out of the mitochondria. when too many or too few proteins move in and out of the mitochondria, energy production and mitochondrial survival can be reduced. tissues that have high energy demands, such as the heart and the brain, are especially susceptible to decreases in cellular energy production. it is likely that this loss of cellular energy damages these and other tissues, leading to heart problems, movement difficulties, and other features of dcma syndrome."
is dilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia syndrome inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what are the genetic changes related to wagr syndrome ?,"wagr syndrome is caused by a deletion of genetic material on the short (p) arm of chromosome 11. the size of the deletion varies among affected individuals. the signs and symptoms of wagr syndrome are related to the loss of multiple genes on the short arm of chromosome 11. wagr syndrome is often described as a contiguous gene deletion syndrome because it results from the loss of several neighboring genes. the pax6 and wt1 genes are always deleted in people with the typical signs and symptoms of this disorder. because changes in the pax6 gene can affect eye development, researchers think that the loss of the pax6 gene is responsible for the characteristic eye features of wagr syndrome. the pax6 gene may also affect brain development. wilms tumor and genitourinary abnormalities are often the result of mutations in the wt1 gene, so deletion of the wt1 gene is very likely the cause of these features in wagr syndrome. in people with wagro syndrome, the chromosome 11 deletion includes an additional gene, bdnf. this gene is active (expressed) in the brain and plays a role in the survival of nerve cells (neurons). the protein produced from the bdnf gene is thought to be involved in the management of eating, drinking, and body weight. loss of the bdnf gene is likely responsible for childhood-onset obesity in people with wagro syndrome. people with wagro syndrome may be at greater risk of neurological problems such as intellectual disability and autism than those with wagr syndrome. it is unclear whether this increased risk is due to the loss of the bdnf gene or other nearby genes. research is ongoing to identify additional genes deleted in people with wagr syndrome and to determine how their loss leads to the other features of the disorder."
is wagr syndrome inherited ?,"most cases of wagr syndrome are not inherited. they result from a chromosomal deletion that occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early fetal development. affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family. some affected individuals inherit a chromosome 11 with a deleted segment from an unaffected parent. in these cases, the parent carries a chromosomal rearrangement called a balanced translocation, in which no genetic material is gained or lost. balanced translocations usually do not cause any health problems; however, they can become unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. children who inherit an unbalanced translocation can have a chromosomal rearrangement with extra or missing genetic material. individuals with wagr syndrome who inherit an unbalanced translocation are missing genetic material from the short arm of chromosome 11, which results in an increased risk of wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and intellectual disability."
what is (are) hirschsprung disease ?,"hirschsprung disease is an intestinal disorder characterized by the absence of nerves in parts of the intestine. this condition occurs when the nerves in the intestine (enteric nerves) do not form properly during development before birth (embryonic development). this condition is usually identified in the first two months of life, although less severe cases may be diagnosed later in childhood. enteric nerves trigger the muscle contractions that move stool through the intestine. without these nerves in parts of the intestine, the material cannot be pushed through, causing severe constipation or complete blockage of the intestine in people with hirschsprung disease. other signs and symptoms of this condition include vomiting, abdominal pain or swelling, diarrhea, poor feeding, malnutrition, and slow growth. people with this disorder are at risk of developing more serious conditions such as inflammation of the intestine (enterocolitis) or a hole in the wall of the intestine (intestinal perforation), which can cause serious infection and may be fatal. there are two main types of hirschsprung disease, known as short-segment disease and long-segment disease, which are defined by the region of the intestine lacking nerve cells. in short-segment disease, nerve cells are missing from only the last segment of the large intestine. this type is most common, occurring in approximately 80 percent of people with hirschsprung disease. for unknown reasons, short-segment disease is four times more common in men than in women. long-segment disease occurs when nerve cells are missing from most of the large intestine and is the more severe type. long-segment disease is found in approximately 20 percent of people with hirschsprung disease and affects men and women equally. very rarely, nerve cells are missing from the entire large intestine and sometimes part of the small intestine (total colonic aganglionosis) or from all of the large and small intestine (total intestinal aganglionosis). hirschsprung disease can occur in combination with other conditions, such as waardenburg syndrome, type iv; mowat-wilson syndrome; or congenital central hypoventilation syndrome. these cases are described as syndromic. hirschsprung disease can also occur without other conditions, and these cases are referred to as isolated or nonsyndromic."
what are the genetic changes related to primary ciliary dyskinesia ?,"primary ciliary dyskinesia can result from mutations in many different genes. these genes provide instructions for making proteins that form the inner structure of cilia and produce the force needed for cilia to bend. coordinated back and forth movement of cilia is necessary for the normal functioning of many organs and tissues. the movement of cilia also helps establish the left-right axis (the imaginary line that separates the left and right sides of the body) during embryonic development. mutations in the genes that cause primary ciliary dyskinesia result in defective cilia that move abnormally or are unable to move (immotile). because cilia have many important functions within the body, defects in these cell structures cause a variety of signs and symptoms. mutations in the dnai1 and dnah5 genes account for up to 30 percent of all cases of primary ciliary dyskinesia. mutations in the other genes associated with this condition are found in only a small percentage of cases. in many people with primary ciliary dyskinesia, the cause of the disorder is unknown."

how many people are affected by 5q minus syndrome ?,"mds affects nearly 1 in 20,000 people in the united states. it is thought that 5q- syndrome accounts for 15 percent of mds cases. unlike other forms of mds, which occur more frequently in men than women, 5q- syndrome is more than twice as common in women."
what are the genetic changes related to 5q minus syndrome ?,"5q- syndrome is caused by deletion of a region of dna from the long (q) arm of chromosome 5. most people with 5q- syndrome are missing a sequence of about 1.5 million dna building blocks (base pairs), also written as 1.5 megabases (mb). however, the size of the deleted region varies. this deletion occurs in immature blood cells during a person's lifetime and affects one of the two copies of chromosome 5 in each cell. the commonly deleted region of dna contains 40 genes, many of which play a critical role in normal blood cell development. research suggests that loss of multiple genes in this region contributes to the features of 5q- syndrome. loss of the rps14 gene leads to the problems with red blood cell development characteristic of 5q- syndrome, and loss of mir145 or mir146a contributes to the megakaryocyte and platelet abnormalities and may promote the overgrowth of immature cells. scientists are still determining how the loss of other genes in the deleted region might be involved in the features of 5q- syndrome."
is metachromatic leukodystrophy inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
is episodic ataxia inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family."

what is (are) friedreich ataxia ?,"friedreich ataxia is a genetic condition that affects the nervous system and causes movement problems. people with this condition develop impaired muscle coordination (ataxia) that worsens over time. other features of this condition include the gradual loss of strength and sensation in the arms and legs, muscle stiffness (spasticity), and impaired speech. individuals with friedreich ataxia often have a form of heart disease called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that enlarges and weakens the heart muscle. some affected individuals develop diabetes, impaired vision, hearing loss, or an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis). most people with friedreich ataxia begin to experience the signs and symptoms of the disorder around puberty. poor balance when walking and slurred speech are often the first noticeable features. affected individuals typically require the use of a wheelchair about 10 years after signs and symptoms appear. about 25 percent of people with friedreich ataxia have an atypical form that begins after age 25. affected individuals who develop friedreich ataxia between ages 26 and 39 are considered to have late-onset friedreich ataxia (lofa). when the signs and symptoms begin after age 40 the condition is called very late-onset friedreich ataxia (vlofa). lofa and vlofa usually progress more slowly than typical friedreich ataxia."
what are the genetic changes related to friedreich ataxia ?,"mutations in the fxn gene cause friedreich ataxia. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called frataxin. although its role is not fully understood, frataxin appears to be important for the normal function of mitochondria, the energy-producing centers within cells. one region of the fxn gene contains a segment of dna known as a gaa trinucleotide repeat. this segment is made up of a series of three dna building blocks (one guanine and two adenines) that appear multiple times in a row. normally, this segment is repeated 5 to 33 times within the fxn gene. in people with friedreich ataxia, the gaa segment is repeated 66 to more than 1,000 times. the length of the gaa trinucleotide repeat appears to be related to the age at which the symptoms of friedreich ataxia appear. people with gaa segments repeated fewer than 300 times tend to have a later appearance of symptoms (after age 25) than those with larger gaa trinucleotide repeats. the abnormally long gaa trinucleotide repeat disrupts the production of frataxin, which severely reduces the amount of this protein in cells. certain nerve and muscle cells cannot function properly with a shortage of frataxin, leading to the characteristic signs and symptoms of friedreich ataxia."
how many people are affected by chronic atrial and intestinal dysrhythmia ?,the prevalence of caid is unknown. at least 17 affected individuals have been described in the medical literature.
what are the genetic changes related to familial osteochondritis dissecans ?,"mutation of the acan gene can cause familial osteochondritis dissecans. the acan gene provides instructions for making the aggrecan protein, which is a component of cartilage. aggrecan attaches to the other components of cartilage, organizing the network of molecules that gives cartilage its strength. in addition, aggrecan attracts water molecules and gives cartilage its gel-like structure. this feature enables the cartilage to resist compression, protecting bones and joints. the acan gene mutation associated with familial osteochondritis dissecans results in an abnormal protein that is unable to attach to the other components of cartilage. as a result, the cartilage is disorganized and weak. it is unclear how the abnormal cartilage leads to the lesions and osteoarthritis characteristic of familial osteochondritis dissecans. researchers suggest that a disorganized cartilage network in growing bones impairs their normal growth, leading to short stature. sporadic osteochondritis dissecans is not caused by genetic changes and is not inherited."

what is (are) slc4a1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis ?,"slc4a1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis is a kidney (renal) disorder that sometimes includes blood cell abnormalities. the kidneys normally filter fluid and waste products from the body and remove them in urine; however, in people with distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys are unable to remove enough acid from the body, and the blood becomes too acidic. this chemical imbalance is called metabolic acidosis. the inability to remove acids from the body often results in slowed growth and may also lead to softening and weakening of the bones, called rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. this bone disorder is characterized by bone pain, bowed legs, and difficulty walking. in addition, most children and adults with slc4a1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis have excess calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria), calcium deposits in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis), and kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). in rare cases, these kidney abnormalities lead to life-threatening kidney failure. affected individuals may also have low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia). individuals with the features described above have complete distal renal tubular acidosis, which usually becomes apparent in childhood. some people do not develop metabolic acidosis even though their kidneys have trouble removing acids; these individuals are said to have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis. additionally, these individuals may have other features of distal renal tubular acidosis, such as bone problems and kidney stones. often, people who initially have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis develop metabolic acidosis later in life. some people with slc4a1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis also have blood cell abnormalities. these can vary in severity from no symptoms to a condition called hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells prematurely break down (undergo hemolysis), causing a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). hemolytic anemia can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), extreme tiredness (fatigue), shortness of breath (dyspnea), and an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly). there are two forms of slc4a1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis; they are distinguished by their inheritance pattern (described below). the autosomal dominant form is more common and is usually less severe than the autosomal recessive form. the autosomal dominant form can be associated with incomplete or complete distal renal tubular acidosis and is rarely associated with blood cell abnormalities. the autosomal recessive form is always associated with complete distal renal tubular acidosis and is more commonly associated with blood cell abnormalities, although not everyone with this form has abnormal blood cells."
is lenz microphthalmia syndrome inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. the gene associated with this condition is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by x-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons."

is fragile xe syndrome inherited ?,"fragile xe syndrome is inherited in an x-linked dominant pattern. a condition is considered x-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in males (who have only one x chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder. in most cases, males experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females. in parents with the aff2 gene premutation, the number of ccg repeats can expand to more than 200 in cells that develop into eggs or sperm. this means that parents with the premutation have an increased risk of having a child with fragile xe syndrome. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons; sons receive a y chromosome from their father, which does not include the aff2 gene."

is atopic dermatitis inherited ?,"allergic disorders tend to run in families; having a parent with atopic dermatitis, asthma, or hay fever raises the chances a person will develop atopic dermatitis. when associated with flg gene mutations, atopic dermatitis follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of the altered flg gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of the disorder. individuals with two altered copies of the gene are more likely to develop the disorder and can have more severe signs and symptoms than individuals with a single altered copy. when associated with other genetic factors, the inheritance pattern is unclear. people with changes in one of the genes associated with atopic dermatitis, including flg, inherit an increased risk of this condition, not the condition itself. not all people with this condition have a mutation in an associated gene, and not all people with a variation in an associated gene will develop the disorder."
what is (are) hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type ii ?,"hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type ii (hsan2) is a condition that primarily affects the sensory nerve cells (sensory neurons), which transmit information about sensations such as pain, temperature, and touch. these sensations are impaired in people with hsan2. in some affected people, the condition may also cause mild abnormalities of the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary body functions such as heart rate, digestion, and breathing. the signs and symptoms of hsan2 typically begin in infancy or early childhood. the first sign of hsan2 is usually numbness in the hands and feet. soon after, affected individuals lose the ability to feel pain or sense hot and cold. people with hsan2 often develop open sores (ulcers) on their hands and feet. because affected individuals cannot feel the pain of these sores, they may not seek treatment right away. without treatment, the ulcers can become infected and may lead to amputation of the affected area. unintentional self-injury is common in people with hsan2, typically by biting the tongue, lips, or fingers. these injuries may lead to spontaneous amputation of the affected areas. affected individuals often have injuries and fractures in their hands, feet, limbs, and joints that go untreated because of the inability to feel pain. repeated injury can lead to a condition called charcot joints, in which the bones and tissue surrounding joints are destroyed. the effects of hsan2 on the autonomic nervous system are more variable. some infants with hsan2 have trouble sucking, which makes it difficult for them to eat. people with hsan2 may experience episodes in which breathing slows or stops for short periods (apnea); digestive problems such as the backflow of stomach acids into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux); or slow eye blink or gag reflexes. affected individuals may also have weak deep tendon reflexes, such as the reflex being tested when a doctor taps the knee with a hammer. some people with hsan2 lose a type of taste bud on the tip of the tongue called lingual fungiform papillae and have a diminished sense of taste."
how many people are affected by microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type ii ?,"mopdii appears to be a rare condition, although its prevalence is unknown."
is histiocytosis-lymphadenopathy plus syndrome inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what are the genetic changes related to mycosis fungoides ?,"the cause of mycosis fungoides is unknown. most affected individuals have one or more chromosomal abnormalities, such as the loss or gain of genetic material. these abnormalities occur during a person's lifetime and are found only in the dna of cancerous cells. abnormalities have been found on most chromosomes, but some regions are more commonly affected than others. people with this condition tend to have additions of dna in regions of chromosomes 7 and 17 or loss of dna from regions of chromosomes 9 and 10. it is unclear whether these genetic changes play a role in mycosis fungoides, although the tendency to acquire chromosome abnormalities (chromosomal instability) is a feature of many cancers. it can lead to genetic changes that allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably. other research suggests that certain variants of hla class ii genes are associated with mycosis fungoides. hla genes help the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). each hla gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. the specific variants are inherited through families. certain variations of hla genes may affect the risk of developing mycosis fungoides or may impact progression of the disorder. it is possible that other factors, such as environmental exposure or certain bacterial or viral infections, are involved in the development of mycosis fungoides. however, the influence of genetic and environmental factors on the development of this complex disorder remains unclear."

how many people are affected by essential pentosuria ?,"essential pentosuria occurs almost exclusively in individuals with ashkenazi jewish ancestry. approximately 1 in 3,300 people in this population are affected."
what are the genetic changes related to familial hypobetalipoproteinemia ?,"most cases of fhbl are caused by mutations in the apob gene. this gene provides instructions for making two versions of the apolipoprotein b protein: a short version called apolipoprotein b-48 and a longer version known as apolipoprotein b-100. both of these proteins are components of lipoproteins, which transport fats and cholesterol in the blood. most apob gene mutations that lead to fhbl cause both versions of apolipoprotein b to be abnormally short. the severity of the condition largely depends on the length of these two versions of apolipoprotein b. severely shortened versions cannot partner with lipoproteins and transport fats and cholesterol. proteins that are only slightly shortened retain some function but partner less effectively with lipoproteins. generally, the signs and symptoms of fhbl are worse if both versions of apolipoprotein b are severely shortened. mild or no signs and symptoms result when the proteins are only slightly shortened. all of these protein changes lead to a reduction of functional apolipoprotein b. as a result, the transportation of dietary fats and cholesterol is decreased or absent. a decrease in fat transport reduces the body's ability to absorb fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the diet. although apob gene mutations are responsible for most cases of fhbl, mutations in a few other genes account for a small number of cases. some people with fhbl do not have identified mutations in any of these genes. changes in other, unidentified genes are likely involved in this condition."
is fragile x-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome inherited ?,"an increased risk of developing fxtas is inherited in an x-linked dominant pattern. the fmr1 gene is located on the x chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. (the y chromosome is the other sex chromosome.) the inheritance is dominant because one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to elevate the risk of developing fxtas. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the fmr1 gene in each cell can lead to the disorder. in males (who have only one x chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell can result in the disorder. however, not all people who inherit an fmr1 premutation will develop fxtas. in x-linked dominant disorders, males typically experience more severe symptoms than females. fewer females than males develop fxtas because the x chromosome that contains the premutation may be turned off (inactive) due to a process called x-inactivation. early in embryonic development in females, one of the two x chromosomes is permanently inactivated in somatic cells (cells other than egg and sperm cells). x-inactivation ensures that females, like males, have only one active copy of the x chromosome in each body cell. usually x-inactivation occurs randomly, so that each x chromosome is active in about half the body's cells. sometimes x-inactivation is not random, and one x chromosome is active in more than half of cells. when x-inactivation does not occur randomly, it is called skewed x-inactivation. researchers suspect that the distribution of active and inactive x chromosomes may help determine the severity of fxtas in females or whether they develop signs and symptoms of the condition."
what is (are) hereditary multiple osteochondromas ?,"hereditary multiple osteochondromas is a condition in which people develop multiple benign (noncancerous) bone tumors called osteochondromas. the number of osteochondromas and the bones on which they are located vary greatly among affected individuals. the osteochondromas are not present at birth, but approximately 96 percent of affected people develop multiple osteochondromas by the time they are 12 years old. osteochondromas typically form at the end of long bones and on flat bones such as the hip and shoulder blade. once people with hereditary multiple osteochondromas reach adult height and their bones stop growing, the development of new osteochondromas also usually stops. multiple osteochondromas can disrupt bone growth and can cause growth disturbances of the arms, hands, and legs, leading to short stature. often these problems with bone growth do not affect the right and left limb equally, resulting in uneven limb lengths (limb length discrepancy). bowing of the forearm or ankle and abnormal development of the hip joints (hip dysplasia) caused by osteochondromas can lead to difficulty walking and general discomfort. multiple osteochondromas may also result in pain, limited range of joint movement, and pressure on nerves, blood vessels, the spinal cord, and tissues surrounding the osteochondromas. osteochondromas are typically benign; however, in some instances these tumors become malignant (cancerous). researchers estimate that people with hereditary multiple osteochondromas have a 1 in 20 to 1 in 200 lifetime risk of developing cancerous osteochondromas (called sarcomas)."

is head and neck squamous cell carcinoma inherited ?,"hnscc is generally not inherited; it typically arises from mutations in the body's cells that occur during an individual's lifetime. this type of alteration is called a somatic mutation. rarely, hnscc is found in several members of a family. these families have inherited disorders that increase the risk of multiple types of cancer."
what is (are) deoxyguanosine kinase deficiency ?,"deoxyguanosine kinase deficiency is an inherited disorder that can cause liver disease and neurological problems. researchers have described two forms of this disorder. the majority of affected individuals have the more severe form, which is called hepatocerebral because of the serious problems it causes in the liver and brain. newborns with the hepatocerebral form of deoxyguanosine kinase deficiency may have a buildup of lactic acid in the body (lactic acidosis) within the first few days after birth. they may also have weakness, behavior changes such as poor feeding and decreased activity, and vomiting. affected newborns sometimes have low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) as a result of liver dysfunction. during the first few weeks of life they begin showing other signs of liver disease which may result in liver failure. they also develop progressive neurological problems including very weak muscle tone (severe hypotonia), abnormal eye movements (nystagmus) and the loss of skills they had previously acquired (developmental regression). children with this form of the disorder usually do not survive past the age of 2 years. some individuals with deoxyguanosine kinase deficiency have a milder form of the disorder without severe neurological problems. liver disease is the primary symptom of this form of the disorder, generally becoming evident during infancy or childhood. occasionally it first appears after an illness such as a viral infection. affected individuals may also develop kidney problems. mild hypotonia is the only neurological effect associated with this form of the disorder."
how many people are affected by xeroderma pigmentosum ?,"xeroderma pigmentosum is a rare disorder; it is estimated to affect about 1 in 1 million people in the united states and europe. the condition is more common in japan, north africa, and the middle east."
what is (are) baller-gerold syndrome ?,"baller-gerold syndrome is a rare condition characterized by the premature fusion of certain skull bones (craniosynostosis) and abnormalities of bones in the arms and hands. people with baller-gerold syndrome have prematurely fused skull bones, most often along the coronal suture, the growth line that goes over the head from ear to ear. other sutures of the skull may be fused as well. these changes result in an abnormally shaped head, a prominent forehead, and bulging eyes with shallow eye sockets (ocular proptosis). other distinctive facial features can include widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), a small mouth, and a saddle-shaped or underdeveloped nose. bone abnormalities in the hands include missing fingers (oligodactyly) and malformed or absent thumbs. partial or complete absence of bones in the forearm is also common. together, these hand and arm abnormalities are called radial ray malformations. people with baller-gerold syndrome may have a variety of additional signs and symptoms including slow growth beginning in infancy, small stature, and malformed or missing kneecaps (patellae). a skin rash often appears on the arms and legs a few months after birth. this rash spreads over time, causing patchy changes in skin coloring, areas of thinning skin (atrophy), and small clusters of blood vessels just under the skin (telangiectases). these chronic skin problems are collectively known as poikiloderma. the varied signs and symptoms of baller-gerold syndrome overlap with features of other disorders, namely rothmund-thomson syndrome and rapadilino syndrome. these syndromes are also characterized by radial ray defects, skeletal abnormalities, and slow growth. all of these conditions can be caused by mutations in the same gene. based on these similarities, researchers are investigating whether baller-gerold syndrome, rothmund-thomson syndrome, and rapadilino syndrome are separate disorders or part of a single syndrome with overlapping signs and symptoms."
what are the genetic changes related to baller-gerold syndrome ?,"mutations in the recql4 gene cause some cases of baller-gerold syndrome. this gene provides instructions for making one member of a protein family called recq helicases. helicases are enzymes that bind to dna and temporarily unwind the two spiral strands (double helix) of the dna molecule. this unwinding is necessary for copying (replicating) dna in preparation for cell division, and for repairing damaged dna. the recql4 protein helps stabilize genetic information in the body's cells and plays a role in replicating and repairing dna. mutations in the recql4 gene prevent cells from producing any recql4 protein or change the way the protein is pieced together, which disrupts its usual function. a shortage of this protein may prevent normal dna replication and repair, causing widespread damage to a person's genetic information over time. it is unclear how a loss of this protein's activity leads to the signs and symptoms of baller-gerold syndrome. this condition has been associated with prenatal (before birth) exposure to a drug called sodium valproate. this medication is used to treat epilepsy and certain psychiatric disorders. some infants whose mothers took sodium valproate during pregnancy were born with the characteristic features of baller-gerold syndrome, such as an unusual skull shape, distinctive facial features, and abnormalities of the arms and hands. however, it is unclear if exposure to the medication caused the condition."
how many people are affected by koolen-de vries syndrome ?,"the prevalence of koolen-de vries syndrome is estimated to be 1 in 16,000. however, the underlying genetic cause is often not identified in people with intellectual disability, so this condition is likely underdiagnosed."
what is (are) mitochondrial membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration ?,"mitochondrial membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration (mpan) is a disorder of the nervous system. the condition typically begins in childhood or early adulthood and worsens (progresses) over time. mpan commonly begins with difficulty walking. as the condition progresses, affected individuals usually develop other movement problems, including muscle stiffness (spasticity) and involuntary muscle cramping (dystonia). many people with mpan have a pattern of movement abnormalities known as parkinsonism. these abnormalities include unusually slow movement (bradykinesia), muscle rigidity, involuntary trembling (tremors), and an inability to hold the body upright and balanced (postural instability). other neurological problems that occur in individuals with mpan include degeneration of the nerve cells that carry visual information from the eyes to the brain (optic atrophy), which can impair vision; problems with speech (dysarthria); difficulty swallowing (dysphagia); and, in later stages of the condition, an inability to control the bowels or the flow of urine (incontinence). additionally, affected individuals may experience a loss of intellectual function (dementia) and psychiatric symptoms such as behavioral problems, mood swings, hyperactivity, and depression. mpan is characterized by an abnormal buildup of iron in certain regions of the brain. because of these deposits, mpan is considered part of a group of conditions known as neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (nbia)."
how many people are affected by adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ?,adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is the most common spinal abnormality in children. it affects an estimated 2 to 3 percent of children in the u.s.
what are the genetic changes related to metatropic dysplasia ?,"metatropic dysplasia is caused by mutations in the trpv4 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein that acts as a calcium channel. the trpv4 channel transports positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) across cell membranes and into cells. the channel is found in many types of cells, but little is known about its function. studies suggest that it plays a role in the normal development of cartilage and bone. this role would help explain why trpv4 gene mutations cause the skeletal abnormalities characteristic of metatropic dysplasia. mutations in the trpv4 gene appear to overactivate the channel, increasing the flow of calcium ions into cells. however, it remains unclear how changes in the activity of the calcium channel lead to the specific features of the condition."
is metatropic dysplasia inherited ?,"metatropic dysplasia is considered an autosomal dominant disorder because one mutated copy of the trpv4 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. most cases of metatropic dysplasia are caused by new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. in a few reported cases, an affected person has inherited the condition from an affected parent. in the past, it was thought that the lethal type of metatropic dysplasia had an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, in which both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. however, more recent research has confirmed that all metatropic dysplasia has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance."
what is (are) weaver syndrome ?,"weaver syndrome is a condition that involves tall stature with or without a large head size (macrocephaly), a variable degree of intellectual disability (usually mild), and characteristic facial features. these features can include a broad forehead; widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism); large, low-set ears; a dimpled chin, and a small lower jaw (micrognathia). people with weaver syndrome can also have joint deformities called contractures that restrict the movement of affected joints. the contractures may particularly affect the fingers and toes, resulting in permanently bent digits (camptodactyly). other features of this disorder can include abnormal curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis); muscle tone that is either reduced (hypotonia) or increased (hypertonia); loose, saggy skin; and a soft-outpouching around the belly-button (umbilical hernia). some affected individuals have abnormalities in the folds (gyri) of the brain, which can be seen by medical imaging; the relationship between these brain abnormalities and the intellectual disability associated with weaver syndrome is unclear. researchers suggest that people with weaver syndrome may have an increased risk of developing cancer, in particular a slightly increased risk of developing a tumor called neuroblastoma in early childhood, but the small number of affected individuals makes it difficult to determine the exact risk."

how many people are affected by hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy ?,"hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy is a rare disorder, but its specific prevalence is unknown. approximately 200 families affected by the disorder have been identified worldwide."
what is (are) psoriatic arthritis ?,"psoriatic arthritis is a condition involving joint inflammation (arthritis) that usually occurs in combination with a skin disorder called psoriasis. psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by patches of red, irritated skin that are often covered by flaky white scales. people with psoriasis may also have changes in their fingernails and toenails, such as nails that become pitted or ridged, crumble, or separate from the nail beds. signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis include stiff, painful joints with redness, heat, and swelling in the surrounding tissues. when the hands and feet are affected, swelling and redness may result in a ""sausage-like"" appearance of the fingers or toes (dactylitis). in most people with psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis appears before joint problems develop. psoriasis typically begins during adolescence or young adulthood, and psoriatic arthritis usually occurs between the ages of 30 and 50. however, both conditions may occur at any age. in a small number of cases, psoriatic arthritis develops in the absence of noticeable skin changes. psoriatic arthritis may be difficult to distinguish from other forms of arthritis, particularly when skin changes are minimal or absent. nail changes and dactylitis are two features that are characteristic of psoriatic arthritis, although they do not occur in all cases. psoriatic arthritis is categorized into five types: distal interphalangeal predominant, asymmetric oligoarticular, symmetric polyarthritis, spondylitis, and arthritis mutilans. the distal interphalangeal predominant type affects mainly the ends of the fingers and toes. the distal interphalangeal joints are those closest to the nails. nail changes are especially frequent with this form of psoriatic arthritis. the asymmetric oligoarticular and symmetric polyarthritis types are the most common forms of psoriatic arthritis. the asymmetric oligoarticular type of psoriatic arthritis involves different joints on each side of the body, while the symmetric polyarthritis form affects the same joints on each side. any joint in the body may be affected in these forms of the disorder, and symptoms range from mild to severe. some individuals with psoriatic arthritis have joint involvement that primarily involves spondylitis, which is inflammation in the joints between the vertebrae in the spine. symptoms of this form of the disorder involve pain and stiffness in the back or neck, and movement is often impaired. joints in the arms, legs, hands, and feet may also be involved. the most severe and least common type of psoriatic arthritis is called arthritis mutilans. fewer than 5 percent of individuals with psoriatic arthritis have this form of the disorder. arthritis mutilans involves severe inflammation that damages the joints in the hands and feet, resulting in deformation and movement problems. bone loss (osteolysis) at the joints may lead to shortening (telescoping) of the fingers and toes. neck and back pain may also occur."
what are the genetic changes related to psoriatic arthritis ?,"the specific cause of psoriatic arthritis is unknown. its signs and symptoms result from excessive inflammation in and around the joints. inflammation occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and facilitate tissue repair. when this has been accomplished, the body ordinarily stops the inflammatory response to prevent damage to its own cells and tissues. mechanical stress on the joints, such as occurs in movement, may result in an excessive inflammatory response in people with psoriatic arthritis. the reasons for this excessive inflammatory response are unclear. researchers have identified changes in several genes that may influence the risk of developing psoriatic arthritis. the most well-studied of these genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (hla) complex. the hla complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). each hla gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. variations of several hla genes seem to affect the risk of developing psoriatic arthritis, as well as the type, severity, and progression of the condition. variations in several other genes have also been associated with psoriatic arthritis. many of these genes are thought to play roles in immune system function. however, variations in these genes probably make only a small contribution to the overall risk of developing psoriatic arthritis. other genetic and environmental factors are also likely to influence a person's chances of developing this disorder."
what is (are) beta-ureidopropionase deficiency ?,"beta-ureidopropionase deficiency is a disorder that causes excessive amounts of molecules called n-carbamyl-beta-aminoisobutyric acid and n-carbamyl-beta-alanine to be released in the urine. neurological problems ranging from mild to severe also occur in some affected individuals. people with beta-ureidopropionase deficiency can have low muscle tone (hypotonia), seizures, speech difficulties, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autistic behaviors that affect communication and social interaction. some people with this condition have an abnormally small head size (microcephaly); they may also have brain abnormalities that can be seen with medical imaging. deterioration of the optic nerve, which carries visual information from the eyes to the brain, can lead to vision loss in this condition. in some people with beta-ureidopropionase deficiency, the disease causes no neurological problems and can only be diagnosed by laboratory testing."
is beta-ureidopropionase deficiency inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."

how many people are affected by nicolaides-baraitser syndrome ?,nicolaides-baraitser syndrome is likely a rare condition; approximately 75 cases have been reported in the scientific literature.
what are the genetic changes related to nicolaides-baraitser syndrome ?,"nicolaides-baraitser syndrome is caused by mutations in the smarca2 gene. this gene provides instructions for making one piece (subunit) of a group of similar protein complexes known as swi/snf complexes. these complexes regulate gene activity (expression) by a process known as chromatin remodeling. chromatin is the network of dna and proteins that packages dna into chromosomes. the structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly dna is packaged. chromatin remodeling is one way gene expression is regulated during development; when dna is tightly packed, gene expression is lower than when dna is loosely packed. to provide energy for chromatin remodeling, the smarca2 protein uses a molecule called atp. the smarca2 gene mutations that cause nicolaides-baraitser syndrome result in the production of an altered protein that interferes with the normal function of the swi/snf complexes. these altered proteins are able to form swi/snf complexes, but the complexes are nonfunctional. as a result, they cannot participate in chromatin remodeling. disturbance of this regulatory process alters the activity of many genes, which likely explains the diverse signs and symptoms of nicolaides-baraitser syndrome."

what is (are) congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency ?,"congenital adrenal hyperplasia (cah) due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency is one of a group of disorders (collectively called congenital adrenal hyperplasia) that affect the adrenal glands. the adrenal glands are located on top of the kidneys and produce a variety of hormones that regulate many essential functions in the body. in people with cah due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency, the adrenal glands produce excess androgens, which are male sex hormones. there are two types of cah due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency, the classic form and the non-classic form. the classic form is the more severe of the two types. females with the classic form of cah due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency have external genitalia that do not look clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia). however, the internal reproductive organs develop normally. males and females with the classic form of this condition have early development of their secondary sexual characteristics such as growth of facial and pubic hair, deepening of the voice, appearance of acne, and onset of a growth spurt. the early growth spurt can prevent growth later in adolescence and lead to short stature in adulthood. in addition, approximately two-thirds of individuals with the classic form of cah due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency have high blood pressure (hypertension). hypertension typically develops within the first year of life. females with the non-classic form of cah due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency have normal female genitalia. as affected females get older, they may develop excessive body hair growth (hirsutism) and irregular menstruation. males with the non-classic form of this condition do not typically have any signs or symptoms except for short stature. hypertension is not a feature of the non-classic form of cah due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency."
what are the genetic changes related to congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency ?,"mutations in the cyp11b1 gene cause cah due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency. the cyp11b1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 11-beta-hydroxylase. this enzyme is found in the adrenal glands, where it helps produce hormones called cortisol and corticosterone. cortisol has numerous functions, such as maintaining blood sugar levels, protecting the body from stress, and suppressing inflammation. corticosterone gets converted to the hormone aldosterone, which helps control blood pressure by maintaining proper salt and fluid levels in the body. cah due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency is caused by a shortage (deficiency) of the 11-beta-hydroxylase enzyme. when 11-beta-hydroxylase is lacking, precursors that are used to form cortisol and corticosterone build up in the adrenal glands and are converted to androgens. the excess production of androgens leads to abnormalities of sexual development, particularly in females with cah due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency. a buildup in the precursors used to form corticosterone increases salt retention, leading to hypertension in individuals with the classic form of cah due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency. the amount of functional 11-beta-hydroxylase enzyme that an individual produces typically determines the extent of abnormal sexual development. individuals with the classic form of the condition usually have cyp11b1 gene mutations that result in the production of an enzyme with low levels of function or no function at all. individuals with the non-classic form of the condition typically have cyp11b1 gene mutations that lead to the production of an enzyme with moderately reduced function. the severity of the signs and symptoms of sexual development do not appear to be related to the severity of the hypertension."

what is (are) lattice corneal dystrophy type i ?,"lattice corneal dystrophy type i is an eye disorder that affects the clear, outer covering of the eye called the cornea. the cornea must remain clear for an individual to see properly; however, in lattice corneal dystrophy type i, protein clumps known as amyloid deposits cloud the cornea, which leads to vision impairment. the cornea is made up of several layers of tissue, and in lattice corneal dystrophy type i, the deposits form in the stromal layer. the amyloid deposits form as delicate, branching fibers that create a lattice pattern. affected individuals often have recurrent corneal erosions, which are caused by separation of particular layers of the cornea from one another. corneal erosions are very painful and can cause sensitivity to bright light (photophobia). lattice corneal dystrophy type i is usually bilateral, which means it affects both eyes. the condition becomes apparent in childhood or adolescence and leads to vision problems by early adulthood."
what is (are) pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent epilepsy ?,"pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent epilepsy is a condition that involves seizures beginning soon after birth or, in some cases, before birth. the seizures typically involve irregular involuntary muscle contractions (myoclonus), abnormal eye movements, and convulsions. most babies with this condition are born prematurely and may have a temporary, potentially toxic, increase in lactic acid in the blood (lactic acidosis). additionally, some infants have a slow heart rate and a lack of oxygen during delivery (fetal distress). anticonvulsant drugs, which are usually given to control seizures, are ineffective in people with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent epilepsy. instead, individuals with this type of epilepsy are medically treated with large daily doses of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (a form of vitamin b6). if left untreated, people with this condition can develop severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), which can lead to death. even though seizures can be controlled with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, neurological problems such as developmental delay and learning disorders may still occur."
what is (are) complete lcat deficiency ?,"complete lcat deficiency is a disorder that primarily affects the eyes and kidneys. in complete lcat deficiency, the clear front surface of the eyes (the corneas) gradually becomes cloudy. the cloudiness, which generally first appears in early childhood, consists of small grayish dots of cholesterol (opacities) distributed across the corneas. cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is produced in the body and obtained from foods that come from animals; it aids in many functions of the body but can become harmful in excessive amounts. as complete lcat deficiency progresses, the corneal cloudiness worsens and can lead to severely impaired vision. people with complete lcat deficiency often have kidney disease that begins in adolescence or early adulthood. the kidney problems get worse over time and may eventually lead to kidney failure. individuals with this disorder also usually have a condition known as hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells are broken down (undergo hemolysis) prematurely, resulting in a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). anemia can cause pale skin, weakness, fatigue, and more serious complications. other features of complete lcat deficiency that occur in some affected individuals include enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly), spleen (splenomegaly), or lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) or an accumulation of fatty deposits on the artery walls (atherosclerosis)."
is lung cancer inherited ?,"most cases of lung cancer are not related to inherited gene changes. these cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the lung. when lung cancer is related to inherited gene changes, the cancer risk is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing cancer. it is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop lung cancer."

what is (are) facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy ?,"facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is a disorder characterized by muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy). this condition gets its name from the muscles that are affected most often: those of the face (facio-), around the shoulder blades (scapulo-), and in the upper arms (humeral). the signs and symptoms of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy usually appear in adolescence. however, the onset and severity of the condition varies widely. milder cases may not become noticeable until later in life, whereas rare severe cases become apparent in infancy or early childhood. weakness involving the facial muscles or shoulders is usually the first symptom of this condition. facial muscle weakness often makes it difficult to drink from a straw, whistle, or turn up the corners of the mouth when smiling. weakness in muscles around the eyes can prevent the eyes from closing fully while a person is asleep, which can lead to dry eyes and other eye problems. for reasons that are unclear, weakness may be more severe in one side of the face than the other. weak shoulder muscles tend to make the shoulder blades (scapulae) protrude from the back, a common sign known as scapular winging. weakness in muscles of the shoulders and upper arms can make it difficult to raise the arms over the head or throw a ball. the muscle weakness associated with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy worsens slowly over decades and may spread to other parts of the body. weakness in muscles of the lower legs can lead to a condition called foot drop, which affects walking and increases the risk of falls. muscular weakness in the hips and pelvis can make it difficult to climb stairs or walk long distances. additionally, affected individuals may have an exaggerated curvature of the lower back (lordosis) due to weak abdominal muscles. about 20 percent of affected individuals eventually require the use of a wheelchair. additional signs and symptoms of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy can include mild high-tone hearing loss and abnormalities involving the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). these signs are often not noticeable and may be discovered only during medical testing. rarely, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy affects the heart (cardiac) muscle or muscles needed for breathing. researchers have described two types of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy: type 1 (fshd1) and type 2 (fshd2). the two types have the same signs and symptoms and are distinguished by their genetic cause."
what is (are) roberts syndrome ?,"roberts syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by limb and facial abnormalities. affected individuals also grow slowly before and after birth. mild to severe intellectual impairment occurs in half of all people with roberts syndrome. children with roberts syndrome are born with abnormalities of all four limbs. they have shortened arm and leg bones (hypomelia), particularly the bones in their forearms and lower legs. in severe cases, the limbs may be so short that the hands and feet are located very close to the body (phocomelia). people with roberts syndrome may also have abnormal or missing fingers and toes, and joint deformities (contractures) commonly occur at the elbows and knees. the limb abnormalities are very similar on the right and left sides of the body, but arms are usually more severely affected than legs. individuals with roberts syndrome typically have numerous facial abnormalities, including an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate), a small chin (micrognathia), ear abnormalities, wide-set eyes (hypertelorism), outer corners of the eyes that point downward (down-slanting palpebral fissures), small nostrils, and a beaked nose. they may have a small head size (microcephaly), and in severe cases affected individuals have a sac-like protrusion of the brain (encephalocele) at the front of their head. in addition, people with roberts syndrome may have heart, kidney, and genital abnormalities. infants with a severe form of roberts syndrome are often stillborn or die shortly after birth. mildly affected individuals may live into adulthood. a condition called sc phocomelia syndrome was originally thought to be distinct from roberts syndrome; however, it is now considered to be a mild variant. ""sc"" represents the first letters of the surnames of the two families first diagnosed with this disorder."
what are the genetic changes related to roberts syndrome ?,"mutations in the esco2 gene cause roberts syndrome. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that is important for proper chromosome separation during cell division. before cells divide, they must copy all of their chromosomes. the copied dna from each chromosome is arranged into two identical structures, called sister chromatids. the esco2 protein plays an important role in establishing the glue that holds the sister chromatids together until the chromosomes are ready to separate. all identified mutations in the esco2 gene prevent the cell from producing any functional esco2 protein, which causes some of the glue between sister chromatids to be missing around the chromosome's constriction point (centromere). in roberts syndrome, cells respond to abnormal sister chromatid attachment by delaying cell division. delayed cell division can be a signal that the cell should undergo self-destruction. the signs and symptoms of roberts syndrome may result from the loss of cells from various tissues during early development. because both mildly and severely affected individuals lack any functional esco2 protein, the underlying cause of the variation in disease severity remains unknown. researchers suspect that other genetic and environmental factors may be involved."

"what are the genetic changes related to t-cell immunodeficiency, congenital alopecia, and nail dystrophy ?","t-cell immunodeficiency, congenital alopecia, and nail dystrophy results from mutations in the foxn1 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that is important for development of the skin, hair, nails, and immune system. studies suggest that this protein helps guide the formation of hair follicles and the growth of fingernails and toenails. the foxn1 protein also plays a critical role in the formation of the thymus, which is a gland located behind the breastbone where t cells mature and become functional. researchers suspect that the foxn1 protein is also involved in the development of the central nervous system, although its role is unclear. mutations in the foxn1 gene prevent cells from making any functional foxn1 protein. without this protein, hair and nails cannot grow normally. a lack of foxn1 protein also prevents the formation of the thymus. when this gland is not present, the immune system cannot produce mature, functional t cells to fight infections. as a result, people with t-cell immunodeficiency, congenital alopecia, and nail dystrophy develop recurrent serious infections starting early in life."
"is t-cell immunodeficiency, congenital alopecia, and nail dystrophy inherited ?","this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. however, some people who carry one copy of a mutated foxn1 gene have abnormal fingernails or toenails."

is hypochondroplasia inherited ?,"hypochondroplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. most people with hypochondroplasia have average-size parents; these cases result from a new mutation in the fgfr3 gene. in the remaining cases, people with hypochondroplasia have inherited an altered fgfr3 gene from one or two affected parents. individuals who inherit two altered copies of this gene typically have more severe problems with bone growth than those who inherit a single fgfr3 mutation."
what is (are) refsum disease ?,"refsum disease is an inherited condition that causes vision loss, absence of the sense of smell (anosmia), and a variety of other signs and symptoms. the vision loss associated with refsum disease is caused by an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa. this disorder affects the retina, the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye. vision loss occurs as the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate. the first sign of retinitis pigmentosa is usually a loss of night vision, which often becomes apparent in childhood. over a period of years, the disease disrupts side (peripheral) vision and may eventually lead to blindness. vision loss and anosmia are seen in almost everyone with refsum disease, but other signs and symptoms vary. about one-third of affected individuals are born with bone abnormalities of the hands and feet. features that appear later in life can include progressive muscle weakness and wasting; poor balance and coordination (ataxia); hearing loss; and dry, scaly skin (ichthyosis). additionally, some people with refsum disease develop an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) and related heart problems that can be life-threatening."

what are the genetic changes related to malignant hyperthermia ?,"variations of the cacna1s and ryr1 genes increase the risk of developing malignant hyperthermia. researchers have described at least six forms of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, which are caused by mutations in different genes. mutations in the ryr1 gene are responsible for a form of the condition known as mhs1. these mutations account for most cases of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. another form of the condition, mhs5, results from mutations in the cacna1s gene. these mutations are less common, causing less than 1 percent of all cases of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. the ryr1 and cacna1s genes provide instructions for making proteins that play essential roles in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). for the body to move normally, these muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. muscle contractions are triggered by the flow of certain charged atoms (ions) into muscle cells. the proteins produced from the ryr1 and cacna1s genes are involved in the movement of calcium ions within muscle cells. in response to certain signals, the cacna1s protein helps activate the ryr1 channel, which releases stored calcium ions within muscle cells. the resulting increase in calcium ion concentration inside muscle cells stimulates muscle fibers to contract. mutations in the ryr1 or cacna1s gene cause the ryr1 channel to open more easily and close more slowly in response to certain drugs. as a result, large amounts of calcium ions are released from storage within muscle cells. an overabundance of available calcium ions causes skeletal muscles to contract abnormally, which leads to muscle rigidity in people with malignant hyperthermia. an increase in calcium ion concentration within muscle cells also activates processes that generate heat (leading to increased body temperature) and produce excess acid (leading to acidosis). the genetic causes of several other types of malignant hyperthermia (mhs2, mhs4, and mhs6) are still under study. a form of the condition known as mhs3 has been linked to the cacna2d1 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an essential role in activating the ryr1 channel to release calcium ions into muscle cells. although this gene is thought to be related to malignant hyperthermia in a few families, no causative mutations have been identified."
what are the genetic changes related to cryptogenic cirrhosis ?,"unlike most cases of cirrhosis, cryptogenic cirrhosis is not caused by the hepatitis c or b virus or chronic alcohol use. a diagnosis of cryptogenic cirrhosis is typically given when all other causes of cirrhosis have been ruled out. when a disorder occurs without an apparent underlying reason, it is described as cryptogenic. research has shown that many cases of cryptogenic cirrhosis likely result from a condition called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld). in nafld, fat accumulates in the liver, impairing its function. if the fat buildup leads to inflammation and damage to liver tissue, nafld progresses to a condition called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (nash). long term inflammation in people with nash can cause the formation of scar tissue and a decrease in fat buildup. as a result, individuals progress from nash to cirrhosis. cryptogenic cirrhosis may also develop from autoimmune hepatitis, which is a condition that occurs when the body's immune system malfunctions and attacks the liver, causing inflammation and liver damage. in very rare cases, cryptogenic cirrhosis has been associated with mutations in genes that provide instructions for making certain keratin proteins. keratins are a group of tough, fibrous proteins that form the structural framework of certain cells, particularly cells that make up the skin, hair, nails, and similar tissues. people with these keratin gene mutations are more likely to have fibrous deposits in their livers than individuals without the mutations. these deposits impair liver function, leading to cirrhosis. mutations in these genes have also been found in people with other liver disorders. in many cases, the cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis is unknown. many people with predisposing conditions do not develop cirrhosis. researchers are working to discover the causes of cryptogenic cirrhosis as well as to find out why some people seem to be protected from developing cirrhosis and others seem to be susceptible."
what are the genetic changes related to glanzmann thrombasthenia ?,"mutations in the itga2b or itgb3 gene cause glanzmann thrombasthenia. these genes provide instructions for making the two parts (subunits) of a receptor protein called integrin alphaiib/beta3 (iib3). this protein is abundant on the surface of platelets. platelets are small cell fragments that circulate in blood and are an essential component of blood clots. during clot formation, integrin iib3 helps platelets bind together. blood clots protect the body after injury by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss. itga2b or itgb3 gene mutations result in a shortage (deficiency) of functional integrin iib3. as a result, platelets cannot clump together to form a blood clot, leading to prolonged bleeding. three types of glanzmann thrombasthenia have been classified according to the amount of integrin iib3 that is available. people with type i (the most common type) have less than 5 percent of normal integrin iib3 levels, people with type ii have between 5 and 20 percent of normal integrin iib3 levels, and people with the variant type have adequate integrin iib3 levels but produce only nonfunctional integrin. some people with glanzmann thrombasthenia do not have an identified mutation in either the itga2b or itgb3 gene; the cause of the disorder in these individuals is unknown."

what is (are) glycogen storage disease type vii ?,"glycogen storage disease type vii (gsdvii) is an inherited disorder caused by an inability to break down a complex sugar called glycogen in muscle cells. a lack of glycogen breakdown interferes with the function of muscle cells. there are four types of gsdvii. they are differentiated by their signs and symptoms and the age at which symptoms first appear. the classical form of gsdvii is the most common form. its features usually appear in childhood. this form is characterized by muscle pain and cramps, often following moderate exercise; strenuous exercise can lead to nausea and vomiting. during exercise, muscle tissue can be abnormally broken down, releasing a protein called myoglobin. this protein is processed by the kidneys and released in the urine (myoglobinuria). if untreated, myoglobinuria can damage the kidneys and lead to kidney failure. some people with the classical form of gsdvii develop high levels of a waste product called uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia) because the damaged kidneys are unable to remove uric acid effectively. affected individuals may also have elevated levels of a molecule called bilirubin in the blood that can cause yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). individuals with classical gsdvii often have elevated levels of an enzyme called creatine kinase in their blood. this finding is a common indicator of muscle disease. infants with the severe infantile form of gsdvii have low muscle tone (hypotonia) at birth, which leads to muscle weakness (myopathy) that worsens over time. affected infants have a weakened and enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy) and difficulty breathing normally. individuals with this form of gsdvii usually do not survive past their first year of life. in the late-onset form of gsdvii, myopathy is typically the only feature. the muscle weakness appears in adulthood, although some individuals have difficulty with sustained exercise starting in childhood. the weakness generally affects the muscles closest to the center of the body (proximal muscles). the hemolytic form of gsdvii is characterized by hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells are broken down (undergo hemolysis) prematurely, causing a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). people with the hemolytic form of gsdvii do not experience any signs or symptoms of muscle pain or weakness related to the disorder."
how many people are affected by glycogen storage disease type vii ?,gsdvii is thought to be a rare condition; more than 100 cases have been described in the scientific literature.

what are the genetic changes related to sialuria ?,"mutations in the gne gene cause sialuria. the gne gene provides instructions for making an enzyme found in cells and tissues throughout the body. this enzyme is involved in a chemical pathway that produces sialic acid, which is a simple sugar that attaches to the ends of more complex molecules on the surface of cells. by modifying these molecules, sialic acid influences a wide variety of cellular functions including cell movement (migration), attachment of cells to one another (adhesion), signaling between cells, and inflammation. the enzyme produced from the gne gene is carefully controlled to ensure that cells produce an appropriate amount of sialic acid. a feedback system shuts off the enzyme when no more sialic acid is needed. the mutations responsible for sialuria disrupt this feedback mechanism, resulting in an overproduction of sialic acid. this simple sugar builds up within cells and is excreted in urine. researchers are working to determine how an accumulation of sialic acid in the body interferes with normal development in people with sialuria."

what is (are) genitopatellar syndrome ?,"genitopatellar syndrome is a rare condition characterized by genital abnormalities, missing or underdeveloped kneecaps (patellae), intellectual disability, and abnormalities affecting other parts of the body. the genital abnormalities in affected males typically include undescended testes (cryptorchidism) and underdevelopment of the scrotum. affected females can have an enlarged clitoris (clitoromegaly) and small labia. missing or underdeveloped patellae is the most common skeletal abnormality associated with genitopatellar syndrome. affected individuals may have additional skeletal problems, including joint deformities (contractures) involving the hips and knees or an inward- and upward-turning foot called a clubfoot. bone abnormalities of the spine, ribs, collarbone (clavicle), and pelvis have also been reported. genitopatellar syndrome is also associated with delayed development and intellectual disability, which are often severe. affected individuals may have an usually small head (microcephaly) and structural brain abnormalities, including underdeveloped or absent tissue connecting the left and right halves of the brain (agenesis of the corpus callosum). people with genitopatellar syndrome may have distinctive facial features such as prominent cheeks and eyes, a nose with a rounded tip or a broad bridge, an unusually small chin (micrognathia) or a chin that protrudes (prognathism), and a narrowing of the head at the temples. many affected infants have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) that leads to breathing and feeding difficulties. the condition can also be associated with abnormalities of the heart, kidneys, and teeth."
what is (are) progressive supranuclear palsy ?,"progressive supranuclear palsy is a brain disorder that affects movement, vision, speech, and thinking ability (cognition). the signs and symptoms of this disorder usually become apparent in mid- to late adulthood, most often in a person's 60s. most people with progressive supranuclear palsy survive 5 to 9 years after the disease first appears, although a few affected individuals have lived for more than a decade. loss of balance and frequent falls are the most common early signs of progressive supranuclear palsy. affected individuals have problems with walking, including poor coordination and an unsteady, lurching gait. other movement abnormalities develop as the disease progresses, including unusually slow movements (bradykinesia), clumsiness, and stiffness of the trunk muscles. these problems worsen with time, and most affected people ultimately require wheelchair assistance. progressive supranuclear palsy is also characterized by abnormal eye movements, which typically develop several years after the other movement problems first appear. restricted up-and-down eye movement (vertical gaze palsy) is a hallmark of this disease. other eye movement problems include difficulty opening and closing the eyelids, infrequent blinking, and pulling back (retraction) of the eyelids. these abnormalities can lead to blurred vision, an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), and a staring gaze. additional features of progressive supranuclear palsy include slow and slurred speech (dysarthria) and trouble swallowing (dysphagia). most affected individuals also experience changes in personality and behavior, such as a general loss of interest and enthusiasm (apathy). they develop problems with cognition, including difficulties with attention, planning, and problem solving. as the cognitive and behavioral problems worsen, affected individuals increasingly require help with personal care and other activities of daily living."
what are the genetic changes related to emery-dreifuss muscular dystrophy ?,"mutations in the emd and lmna genes cause emery-dreifuss muscular dystrophy. the emd and lmna genes provide instructions for making proteins that are components of the nuclear envelope, which surrounds the nucleus in cells. the nuclear envelope regulates the movement of molecules into and out of the nucleus, and researchers believe it may play a role in regulating the activity of certain genes. most cases of emery-dreifuss muscular dystrophy are caused by mutations in the emd gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called emerin, which appears to be essential for the normal function of skeletal and cardiac muscle. most emd gene mutations prevent the production of any functional emerin. it remains unclear how a lack of this protein results in the signs and symptoms of emery-dreifuss muscular dystrophy. less commonly, emery-dreifuss muscular dystrophy results from mutations in the lmna gene. this gene provides instructions for making two very similar proteins, lamin a and lamin c. most of the lmna mutations that cause this condition result in the production of an altered version of these proteins. researchers are investigating how the altered versions of lamins a and c lead to muscle wasting and heart problems in people with emery-dreifuss muscular dystrophy."

what is (are) gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina ?,"gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina, which is often shortened to gyrate atrophy, is an inherited disorder characterized by progressive vision loss. people with this disorder have an ongoing loss of cells (atrophy) in the retina, which is the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye, and in a nearby tissue layer called the choroid. during childhood, they begin experiencing nearsightedness (myopia), difficulty seeing in low light (night blindness), and loss of side (peripheral) vision. over time, their field of vision continues to narrow, resulting in tunnel vision. many people with gyrate atrophy also develop clouding of the lens of the eyes (cataracts). these progressive vision changes lead to blindness by about the age of 50. most people with gyrate atrophy have no symptoms other than vision loss, but some have additional features of the disorder. occasionally, newborns with gyrate atrophy develop excess ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia), which may lead to poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, or coma. neonatal hyperammonemia associated with gyrate atrophy generally responds quickly to treatment and does not recur after the newborn period. gyrate atrophy usually does not affect intelligence; however, abnormalities may be observed in brain imaging or other neurological testing. in some cases, mild to moderate intellectual disability is associated with gyrate atrophy. gyrate atrophy may also cause disturbances in the nerves connecting the brain and spinal cord to muscles and sensory cells (peripheral nervous system). in some people with the disorder these abnormalities lead to numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet, while in others they are detectable only by electrical testing of the nerve impulses. in some people with gyrate atrophy, a particular type of muscle fibers (type ii fibers) break down over time. while this muscle abnormality usually causes no symptoms, it may result in mild weakness."
is melnick-needles syndrome inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an x-linked dominant pattern. the gene associated with this condition is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in males (who have only one x chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder. in most cases, males experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons."
what are the genetic changes related to arterial tortuosity syndrome ?,"arterial tortuosity syndrome is caused by mutations in the slc2a10 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called glut10. the level of glut10 appears to be involved in the regulation of a process called the transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-) signaling pathway. this pathway is involved in cell growth and division (proliferation) and the process by which cells mature to carry out special functions (differentiation). the tgf- signaling pathway is also involved in bone and blood vessel development and the formation of the extracellular matrix, an intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells and defines the structure and properties of connective tissues. slc2a10 gene mutations that cause arterial tortuosity syndrome reduce or eliminate glut10 function. by mechanisms that are not well understood, a lack (deficiency) of functional glut10 protein leads to overactivity (upregulation) of tgf- signaling. excessive growth signaling results in elongation of the arteries, leading to tortuosity. overactive tgf- signaling also interferes with normal formation of the connective tissues in other parts of the body, leading to the additional signs and symptoms of arterial tortuosity syndrome."

is cherubism inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder."
what are the genetic changes related to gracile syndrome ?,"gracile syndrome is caused by a mutation in the bcs1l gene. the protein produced from this gene is found in cell structures called mitochondria, which convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. in mitochondria, the bcs1l protein plays a role in oxidative phosphorylation, which is a multistep process through which cells derive much of their energy. the bcs1l protein is critical for the formation of a group of proteins known as complex iii, which is one of several protein complexes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. the genetic change involved in gracile syndrome alters the bcs1l protein, and the abnormal protein is broken down more quickly than the normal protein. what little protein remains is able to help form some complete complex iii, although the amount is severely reduced, particularly in the liver and kidneys. as a result, complex iii activity and oxidative phosphorylation are decreased in these organs in people with gracile syndrome. without energy, these organs become damaged, leading to many of the features of gracile syndrome. it is not clear why a change in the bcs1l gene leads to iron accumulation in people with this condition."
is gracile syndrome inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
how many people are affected by paroxysmal extreme pain disorder ?,paroxysmal extreme pain disorder is a rare condition; approximately 80 affected individuals have been described in the scientific literature.
what are the genetic changes related to paroxysmal extreme pain disorder ?,"mutations in the scn9a gene cause paroxysmal extreme pain disorder. the scn9a gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha subunit) of a sodium channel called nav1.7. sodium channels transport positively charged sodium atoms (sodium ions) into cells and play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. nav1.7 sodium channels are found in nerve cells called nociceptors that transmit pain signals to the spinal cord and brain. the scn9a gene mutations that cause paroxysmal extreme pain disorder result in nav1.7 sodium channels that do not close completely when it is turned off, allowing sodium ions to flow abnormally into nociceptors. this increase in sodium ions enhances transmission of pain signals, leading to the pain attacks experienced by people with paroxysmal extreme pain disorder. it is unknown why the pain attacks associated with this condition change location over time or what causes the other features of this condition such as seizures and changes in breathing."

how many people are affected by x-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia ?,the incidence of xlag is unknown; approximately 30 affected families have been described in the medical literature.
what are the genetic changes related to neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease ?,"mutations in the nlrp3 gene (also known as cias1) cause nomid. the nlrp3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cryopyrin. cryopyrin belongs to a family of proteins called nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (nlr) proteins. these proteins are involved in the immune system, helping to regulate the process of inflammation. inflammation occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and facilitate tissue repair. when this has been accomplished, the body stops (inhibits) the inflammatory response to prevent damage to its own cells and tissues. cryopyrin is involved in the assembly of a molecular complex called an inflammasome, which helps trigger the inflammatory process. researchers believe that nlrp3 mutations that cause nomid result in a hyperactive cryopyrin protein and an inappropriate inflammatory response. impairment of the body's mechanisms for controlling inflammation results in the episodes of fever and widespread inflammatory damage to the body's cells and tissues seen in nomid. in about 50 percent of individuals diagnosed with nomid, no mutations in the nlrp3 gene have been identified. the cause of nomid in these individuals is unknown."
what is (are) color vision deficiency ?,"color vision deficiency (sometimes called color blindness) represents a group of conditions that affect the perception of color. red-green color vision defects are the most common form of color vision deficiency. affected individuals have trouble distinguishing between some shades of red, yellow, and green. blue-yellow color vision defects (also called tritan defects), which are rarer, cause problems with differentiating shades of blue and green and cause difficulty distinguishing dark blue from black. these two forms of color vision deficiency disrupt color perception but do not affect the sharpness of vision (visual acuity). a less common and more severe form of color vision deficiency called blue cone monochromacy causes very poor visual acuity and severely reduced color vision. affected individuals have additional vision problems, which can include increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), involuntary back-and-forth eye movements (nystagmus), and nearsightedness (myopia). blue cone monochromacy is sometimes considered to be a form of achromatopsia, a disorder characterized by a partial or total lack of color vision with other vision problems."
how many people are affected by color vision deficiency ?,"red-green color vision defects are the most common form of color vision deficiency. this condition affects males much more often than females. among populations with northern european ancestry, it occurs in about 1 in 12 males and 1 in 200 females. red-green color vision defects have a lower incidence in almost all other populations studied. blue-yellow color vision defects affect males and females equally. this condition occurs in fewer than 1 in 10,000 people worldwide. blue cone monochromacy is rarer than the other forms of color vision deficiency, affecting about 1 in 100,000 people worldwide. like red-green color vision defects, blue cone monochromacy affects males much more often than females."
what are the genetic changes related to crouzon syndrome ?,"mutations in the fgfr2 gene cause crouzon syndrome. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 2. among its multiple functions, this protein signals immature cells to become bone cells during embryonic development. mutations in the fgfr2 gene probably overstimulate signaling by the fgfr2 protein, which causes the bones of the skull to fuse prematurely."
is crouzon syndrome inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder."
how many people are affected by polymicrogyria ?,"the prevalence of isolated polymicrogyria is unknown. researchers believe that it may be relatively common overall, although the individual forms of the disorder (such as bilateral generalized polymicrogyria) are probably rare."
what is (are) rett syndrome ?,"rett syndrome is a brain disorder that occurs almost exclusively in girls. the most common form of the condition is known as classic rett syndrome. after birth, girls with classic rett syndrome have 6 to 18 months of apparently normal development before developing severe problems with language and communication, learning, coordination, and other brain functions. early in childhood, affected girls lose purposeful use of their hands and begin making repeated hand wringing, washing, or clapping motions. they tend to grow more slowly than other children and have a small head size (microcephaly). other signs and symptoms that can develop include breathing abnormalities, seizures, an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis), and sleep disturbances. researchers have described several variant or atypical forms of rett syndrome, which can be milder or more severe than the classic form."
is y chromosome infertility inherited ?,"because y chromosome infertility impedes the ability to father children, this condition is usually caused by new deletions on the y chromosome and occurs in men with no history of the disorder in their family. when men with y chromosome infertility do father children, either naturally or with the aid of assisted reproductive technologies, they pass on the genetic changes on the y chromosome to all their sons. as a result, the sons will also have y chromosome infertility. this form of inheritance is called y-linked. daughters, who do not inherit the y chromosome, are not affected."
what are the genetic changes related to aspartylglucosaminuria ?,"mutations in the aga gene cause aspartylglucosaminuria. the aga gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called aspartylglucosaminidase. this enzyme is active in lysosomes, which are structures inside cells that act as recycling centers. within lysosomes, the enzyme helps break down complexes of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) attached to certain proteins (glycoproteins). aga gene mutations result in the absence or shortage of the aspartylglucosaminidase enzyme in lysosomes, preventing the normal breakdown of glycoproteins. as a result, glycoproteins can build up within the lysosomes. excess glycoproteins disrupt the normal functions of the cell and can result in destruction of the cell. a buildup of glycoproteins seems to particularly affect nerve cells in the brain; loss of these cells causes many of the signs and symptoms of aspartylglucosaminuria."
how many people are affected by familial pityriasis rubra pilaris ?,"familial pityriasis rubra pilaris is a rare condition. its incidence is unknown, although the familial form appears to be the least common type of pityriasis rubra pilaris."

what is (are) ehlers-danlos syndrome ?,"ehlers-danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect the connective tissues that support the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues. defects in connective tissues cause the signs and symptoms of ehlers-danlos syndrome, which vary from mildly loose joints to life-threatening complications. previously, there were more than 10 recognized types of ehlers-danlos syndrome, differentiated by roman numerals. in 1997, researchers proposed a simpler classification that reduced the number of major types to six and gave them descriptive names: the classical type (formerly types i and ii), the hypermobility type (formerly type iii), the vascular type (formerly type iv), the kyphoscoliosis type (formerly type via), the arthrochalasia type (formerly types viia and viib), and the dermatosparaxis type (formerly type viic). this six-type classification, known as the villefranche nomenclature, is still commonly used. the types are distinguished by their signs and symptoms, their underlying genetic causes, and their patterns of inheritance. since 1997, several additional forms of the condition have been described. these additional forms appear to be rare, affecting a small number of families, and most have not been well characterized. although all types of ehlers-danlos syndrome affect the joints and skin, additional features vary by type. an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility) occurs with most forms of ehlers-danlos syndrome, particularly the hypermobility type. infants with hypermobile joints often have weak muscle tone, which can delay the development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking. the loose joints are unstable and prone to dislocation and chronic pain. hypermobility and dislocations of both hips at birth are characteristic features in infants with the arthrochalasia type of ehlers-danlos syndrome. many people with ehlers-danlos syndrome have soft, velvety skin that is highly stretchy (elastic) and fragile. affected individuals tend to bruise easily, and some types of the condition also cause abnormal scarring. people with the classical form of ehlers-danlos syndrome experience wounds that split open with little bleeding and leave scars that widen over time to create characteristic ""cigarette paper"" scars. the dermatosparaxis type of the disorder is characterized by skin that sags and wrinkles. extra (redundant) folds of skin may be present as affected children get older. some forms of ehlers-danlos syndrome, notably the vascular type and to a lesser extent the kyphoscoliosis and classical types, can involve serious and potentially life-threatening complications due to unpredictable tearing (rupture) of blood vessels. this rupture can cause internal bleeding, stroke, and shock. the vascular type of ehlers-danlos syndrome is also associated with an increased risk of organ rupture, including tearing of the intestine and rupture of the uterus (womb) during pregnancy. people with the kyphoscoliosis form of ehlers-danlos syndrome experience severe, progressive curvature of the spine that can interfere with breathing."
what are the genetic changes related to ehlers-danlos syndrome ?,"mutations in more than a dozen genes have been found to cause ehlers-danlos syndrome. the classical type results most often from mutations in either the col5a1 gene or the col5a2 gene. mutations in the tnxb gene have been found in a very small percentage of cases of the hypermobility type (although in most cases, the cause of this type is unknown). the vascular type results from mutations in the col3a1 gene. plod1 gene mutations cause the kyphoscoliosis type. mutations in the col1a1 gene or the col1a2 gene result in the arthrochalasia type. the dermatosparaxis type is caused by mutations in the adamts2 gene. the other, less well-characterized forms of ehlers-danlos syndrome result from mutations in other genes, some of which have not been identified. some of the genes associated with ehlers-danlos syndrome, including col1a1, col1a2, col3a1, col5a1, and col5a2, provide instructions for making pieces of several different types of collagen. these pieces assemble to form mature collagen molecules that give structure and strength to connective tissues throughout the body. other genes, including adamts2, plod1, and tnxb, provide instructions for making proteins that process or interact with collagen. mutations that cause the different forms of ehlers-danlos syndrome disrupt the production or processing of collagen, preventing these molecules from being assembled properly. these defects weaken connective tissues in the skin, bones, and other parts of the body, resulting in the characteristic features of this condition."
what is (are) robinow syndrome ?,"robinow syndrome is a rare disorder that affects the development of many parts of the body, particularly the bones. researchers have identified two major types of robinow syndrome. the types are distinguished by the severity of their signs and symptoms and by their pattern of inheritance, autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant. autosomal recessive robinow syndrome is characterized by skeletal abnormalities including shortening of the long bones in the arms and legs, particularly the forearms; abnormally short fingers and toes (brachydactyly); wedge-shaped spinal bones (hemivertebrae) leading to an abnormal curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis); fused or missing ribs; and short stature. affected individuals also have distinctive facial features, such as a broad forehead, prominent and widely spaced eyes, a short nose with an upturned tip, a wide nasal bridge, and a broad and triangle-shaped mouth. together, these facial features are sometimes described as ""fetal facies"" because they resemble the facial structure of a developing fetus. other common features of autosomal recessive robinow syndrome include underdeveloped genitalia in both males and females, and dental problems such as crowded teeth and overgrowth of the gums. kidney and heart defects are also possible. delayed development occurs in 10 to 15 percent of people with this condition, although intelligence is usually normal. autosomal dominant robinow syndrome has signs and symptoms that are similar to, but tend to be milder than, those of the autosomal recessive form. abnormalities of the spine and ribs are rarely seen in the autosomal dominant form, and short stature is less pronounced. a variant form of autosomal dominant robinow syndrome features increased bone mineral density (osteosclerosis) in addition to the signs and symptoms listed above. this variant is called the osteosclerotic form of robinow syndrome."
how many people are affected by robinow syndrome ?,"both the autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant forms of robinow syndrome are rare. fewer than 200 people with autosomal recessive robinow syndrome have been described in the medical literature. this form of the condition has been identified in families from several countries, including turkey, oman, pakistan, and brazil. autosomal dominant robinow syndrome has been diagnosed in fewer than 50 families; about 10 of these families have had the osteosclerotic form."
is focal dermal hypoplasia inherited ?,"focal dermal hypoplasia is inherited in an x-linked dominant pattern. the gene associated with this condition is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. the x chromosome that contains the mutated porcn gene may be turned on (active) or turned off (inactive) due to a process called x-inactivation. early in embryonic development in females, one of the two x chromosomes is permanently inactivated in somatic cells (cells other than egg and sperm cells). x-inactivation ensures that females, like males, have only one active copy of the x chromosome in each body cell. usually x-inactivation occurs randomly, so that each x chromosome is active in about half the body's cells. sometimes x-inactivation is not random, and one x chromosome is active in more than half of cells. when x-inactivation does not occur randomly, it is called skewed x-inactivation. researchers suspect that the distribution of active and inactive x chromosomes may play a role in determining the severity of focal dermal hypoplasia in females. in males (who have only one x chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the porcn gene in each cell appears to be lethal very early in development. a male can be born with focal dermal hypoplasia if he has a porcn gene mutation in only some of his cells (known as mosaicism). affected males typically experience milder symptoms of the disorder than females because more of their cells have a functional copy of the porcn gene. a characteristic of focal dermal hypoplasia is that mildly affected fathers cannot pass this condition to their sons, but they can pass it to their daughters, who are usually more severely affected than they are. women with focal dermal hypoplasia cannot pass this condition to their sons (because it is lethal early in development) but can pass it to their daughters. most cases of focal dermal hypoplasia in females result from new mutations in the porcn gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. when focal dermal hypoplasia occurs in males, it always results from a new mutation in this gene that is not inherited. only about 5 percent of females with this condition inherit a mutation in the porcn gene from a parent."

what are the genetic changes related to autosomal dominant hyper-ige syndrome ?,"mutations in the stat3 gene cause most cases of ad-hies. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in several body systems. to carry out its roles, the stat3 protein attaches to dna and helps control the activity of particular genes. in the immune system, the stat3 protein regulates genes that are involved in the maturation of immune system cells, especially t cells. these cells help control the body's response to foreign invaders such as bacteria and fungi. changes in the stat3 gene alter the structure and function of the stat3 protein, impairing its ability to control the activity of other genes. a shortage of functional stat3 blocks the maturation of t cells (specifically a subset known as th17 cells) and other immune cells. the resulting immune system abnormalities make people with ad-hies highly susceptible to infections, particularly bacterial and fungal infections of the lungs and skin. the stat3 protein is also involved in the formation of cells that build and break down bone tissue, which could help explain why stat3 gene mutations lead to the skeletal and dental abnormalities characteristic of this condition. it is unclear how stat3 gene mutations lead to increased ige levels. when ad-hies is not caused by stat3 gene mutations, the genetic cause of the condition is unknown."
is adcy5-related dyskinesia inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family."

what is (are) purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency ?,"purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency is one of several disorders that damage the immune system and cause severe combined immunodeficiency (scid). people with scid lack virtually all immune protection from foreign invaders such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. affected individuals are prone to repeated and persistent infections that can be very serious or life-threatening. these infections are often caused by ""opportunistic"" organisms that ordinarily do not cause illness in people with a normal immune system. infants with scid typically grow much more slowly than healthy children and experience pneumonia, chronic diarrhea, and widespread skin rashes. without successful treatment to restore immune function, children with scid usually do not survive past early childhood. about two-thirds of individuals with purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency have neurological problems, which may include developmental delay, intellectual disability, difficulties with balance and coordination (ataxia), and muscle stiffness (spasticity). people with purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency are also at increased risk of developing autoimmune disorders, which occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's tissues and organs."
how many people are affected by hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy ?,"the prevalence of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy is unknown. the dutch type is the most common, with over 200 affected individuals reported in the scientific literature."
what is (are) renpenning syndrome ?,"renpenning syndrome is a disorder that almost exclusively affects males, causing developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability, and distinctive physical features. individuals with renpenning syndrome typically have short stature and a small head size (microcephaly). facial features characteristic of this disorder include a long, narrow face; outside corners of the eyes that point upward (upslanting palpebral fissures); a long, bulbous nose with a low-hanging separation between the nostrils (overhanging columella); a shortened space between the nose and mouth (philtrum); and cup-shaped ears. males with renpenning syndrome generally have small testes. seizures and wasting away (atrophy) of muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles) may also occur in this disorder. about 20 percent of individuals with renpenning syndrome also have other features, which may include a gap or split in structures that make up the eye (coloboma), an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate), heart abnormalities, or malformations of the anus. certain combinations of the features that often occur in renpenning syndrome are sometimes called by other names, such as golabi-ito-hall syndrome or sutherland-haan syndrome. however, all these syndromes, which have the same genetic cause, are now generally grouped under the term renpenning syndrome."
what is (are) malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy ?,"malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy (mmpsi) is a severe form of epilepsy that begins very early in life. recurrent seizures begin before the age of 6 months but commonly start within a few weeks of birth. the seizures do not respond well to treatment. although affected individuals may develop normally at first, progression stalls and skills decline when seizures begin; as a result, affected individuals have profound developmental delay. the seizures in mmpsi are described as partial (or focal) because the seizure activity occurs in regions of the brain rather than affecting the entire brain. seizure activity can appear in multiple locations in the brain or move (migrate) from one region to another during an episode. depending on the region affected, seizures can involve sudden redness and warmth (flushing) of the face; drooling; short pauses in breathing (apnea); movement of the head or eyes to one side; twitches in the eyelids or tongue; chewing motions; or jerking of an arm, leg, or both on one side of the body. if seizure activity spreads to affect the entire brain, it causes a loss of consciousness, muscle stiffening, and rhythmic jerking (tonic-clonic seizure). episodes that begin as partial seizures and spread throughout the brain are known as secondarily generalized seizures. initially, the seizures associated with mmpsi are relatively infrequent, occurring every few weeks. within a few months of the seizures starting, though, the frequency increases. affected individuals can have clusters of five to 30 seizures several times a day. each seizure typically lasts seconds to a couple of minutes, but they can be prolonged (classified as status epilepticus). in some cases, the seizure activity may be almost continuous for several days. after a year or more of persistent seizures, the episodes become less frequent. seizures can affect growth of the brain and lead to a small head size (microcephaly). the problems with brain development can also cause profound developmental delay and intellectual impairment. affected babies often lose the mental and motor skills they developed after birth, such as the ability to make eye contact and control their head movement. many have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and become ""floppy."" if seizures can be controlled for a short period, development may improve. some affected children learn to reach for objects or walk. however, most children with this condition do not develop language skills. because of the serious health problems caused by mmpsi, many affected individuals do not survive past infancy or early childhood."
is malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy inherited ?,mmpsi is not inherited from a parent and does not run in families. this condition is caused by a new mutation that occurs very early in embryonic development (called a de novo mutation).
how many people are affected by congenital central hypoventilation syndrome ?,"cchs is a relatively rare disorder. approximately 1,000 individuals with this condition have been identified. researchers believe that some cases of sudden infant death syndrome (sids) or sudden unexplained death in children may be caused by undiagnosed cchs."

is mpv17-related hepatocerebral mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what is (are) desmosterolosis ?,"desmosterolosis is a condition that is characterized by neurological problems, such as brain abnormalities and developmental delay, and can also include other signs and symptoms. children with desmosterolosis have delayed speech and motor skills (such as sitting and walking). later in childhood, some affected individuals are able to walk with support; verbal communication is often limited to a few words or phrases. common brain abnormalities in desmosterolosis include malformation of the tissue that connects the left and right halves of the brain (the corpus callosum) and loss of white matter, which consists of nerve fibers covered by a fatty substance called myelin. people with desmosterolosis commonly have muscle stiffness (spasticity) and stiff, rigid joints (arthrogryposis) affecting their hands and feet. other features seen in some affected individuals include short stature, abnormal head size (either larger or smaller than normal), a small lower jaw (micrognathia), an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate), involuntary eye movements (nystagmus) or eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus), heart defects, and seizures."
is cone-rod dystrophy inherited ?,"cone-rod dystrophy is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. less frequently, this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in most of these cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition. rarely, cone-rod dystrophy is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. the genes associated with this form of the condition are located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by x-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. females with one copy of the altered gene have mild vision problems, such as decreased visual acuity. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons."
how many people are affected by microcephaly-capillary malformation syndrome ?,microcephaly-capillary malformation syndrome is rare. about a dozen people have been diagnosed with the disorder.
is idiopathic inflammatory myopathy inherited ?,"most cases of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. however, several people with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy have had close relatives with autoimmune disorders. autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's tissues and organs. a small percentage of all cases of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy have been reported to run in families; however, the condition does not have a clear pattern of inheritance. multiple genetic and environmental factors likely play a part in determining the risk of developing this disorder. as a result, inheriting a genetic variation linked with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy does not mean that a person will develop the condition."
how many people are affected by schwartz-jampel syndrome ?,schwartz-jampel syndrome appears to be a rare condition. about 150 cases have been reported in the medical literature.
what is (are) juvenile primary lateral sclerosis ?,"juvenile primary lateral sclerosis is a rare disorder characterized by progressive weakness and tightness (spasticity) of muscles in the arms, legs, and face. the features of this disorder are caused by damage to motor neurons, which are specialized nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control muscle movement. symptoms of juvenile primary lateral sclerosis begin in early childhood and progress slowly over many years. early symptoms include clumsiness, muscle weakness and spasticity in the legs, and difficulty with balance. as symptoms progress, the spasticity spreads to the arms and hands and individuals develop slurred speech, drooling, difficulty swallowing, and an inability to walk."

what are the genetic changes related to dihydropyrimidinase deficiency ?,"dihydropyrimidinase deficiency is caused by mutations in the dpys gene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called dihydropyrimidinase. this enzyme is involved in the breakdown of molecules called pyrimidines, which are building blocks of dna and its chemical cousin rna. the dihydropyrimidinase enzyme is involved in the second step of the three-step process that breaks down pyrimidines. this step opens the ring-like structures of molecules called 5,6-dihydrothymine and 5,6-dihydrouracil so that these molecules can be further broken down. the dpys gene mutations that cause dihydropyrimidinase deficiency greatly reduce or eliminate dihydropyrimidinase enzyme function. as a result, the enzyme is unable to begin the breakdown of 5,6-dihydrothymine and 5,6-dihydrouracil. excessive amounts of these molecules accumulate in the blood and in the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord (the cerebrospinal fluid or csf) and are released in the urine. the relationship between the inability to break down 5,6-dihydrothymine and 5,6-dihydrouracil and the specific features of dihydropyrimidinase deficiency is unclear. failure to complete this step in the breakdown of pyrimidines also impedes the final step of the process, which produces molecules called beta-aminoisobutyric acid and beta-alanine. both of these molecules are thought to protect the nervous system and help it function properly. reduced production of beta-aminoisobutyric acid and beta-alanine may impair the function of these molecules in the nervous system, leading to neurological problems in some people with dihydropyrimidinase deficiency. because fluoropyrimidine drugs are broken down by the same three-step process as pyrimidines, deficiency of the dihydropyrimidinase enzyme could lead to the drug buildup that causes fluoropyrimidine toxicity. it is unknown why some people with dihydropyrimidinase deficiency do not develop health problems related to the condition; other genetic and environmental factors likely help determine the effects of this disorder."
what are the genetic changes related to alpha thalassemia ?,"alpha thalassemia typically results from deletions involving the hba1 and hba2 genes. both of these genes provide instructions for making a protein called alpha-globin, which is a component (subunit) of hemoglobin. people have two copies of the hba1 gene and two copies of the hba2 gene in each cell. each copy is called an allele. for each gene, one allele is inherited from a person's father, and the other is inherited from a person's mother. as a result, there are four alleles that produce alpha-globin. the different types of alpha thalassemia result from the loss of some or all of these alleles. hb bart syndrome, the most severe form of alpha thalassemia, results from the loss of all four alpha-globin alleles. hbh disease is caused by a loss of three of the four alpha-globin alleles. in these two conditions, a shortage of alpha-globin prevents cells from making normal hemoglobin. instead, cells produce abnormal forms of hemoglobin called hemoglobin bart (hb bart) or hemoglobin h (hbh). these abnormal hemoglobin molecules cannot effectively carry oxygen to the body's tissues. the substitution of hb bart or hbh for normal hemoglobin causes anemia and the other serious health problems associated with alpha thalassemia. two additional variants of alpha thalassemia are related to a reduced amount of alpha-globin. because cells still produce some normal hemoglobin, these variants tend to cause few or no health problems. a loss of two of the four alpha-globin alleles results in alpha thalassemia trait. people with alpha thalassemia trait may have unusually small, pale red blood cells and mild anemia. a loss of one alpha-globin allele is found in alpha thalassemia silent carriers. these individuals typically have no thalassemia-related signs or symptoms."
how many people are affected by langerhans cell histiocytosis ?,"langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder. its prevalence is estimated at 1 to 2 in 100,000 people."
what are the genetic changes related to langerhans cell histiocytosis ?,"somatic mutations in the braf gene have been identified in the langerhans cells of about half of individuals with langerhans cell histiocytosis. somatic gene mutations are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. these changes are not inherited. the braf gene provides instructions for making a protein that is normally switched on and off in response to signals that control cell growth and development. somatic mutations cause the braf protein in affected cells to be continuously active and to transmit messages to the nucleus even in the absence of these chemical signals. the overactive protein may contribute to the development of langerhans cell histiocytosis by allowing the langerhans cells to grow and divide uncontrollably. changes in other genes have also been identified in the langerhans cells of some individuals with langerhans cell histiocytosis. some researchers believe that additional factors, such as viral infections and environmental toxins, may also influence the development of this complex disorder."
what are the genetic changes related to granulomatosis with polyangiitis ?,"the genetic basis of gpa is not well understood. having a particular version of the hla-dpb1 gene is the strongest genetic risk factor for developing this condition, although several other genes, some of which have not been identified, may be involved. it is likely that a combination of genetic and environmental factors lead to gpa. gpa is an autoimmune disorder. such disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. approximately 90 percent of people with gpa have an abnormal immune protein called an anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (anca) in their blood. antibodies normally bind to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction, but ancas attack normal human proteins. most people with gpa have an anca that attacks the human protein proteinase 3 (pr3). a few affected individuals have an anca that attacks a protein called myeloperoxidase (mpo). when these antibodies attach to the protein they recognize, they trigger inflammation, which contributes to the signs and symptoms of gpa. the hla-dpb1 gene belongs to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (hla) complex. the hla complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). each hla gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. a particular variant of the hla-dpb1 gene called hla-dpb1*0401 has been found more frequently in people with gpa, especially those with ancas, than in people without the condition. because the hla-dpb1 gene is involved in the immune system, changes in it might be related to the autoimmune response and inflammation in the respiratory tract and kidneys characteristic of gpa. however, it is unclear what specific role the hla-dpb1*0401 gene variant plays in development of this condition."
what are the genetic changes related to andermann syndrome ?,"mutations in the slc12a6 gene cause andermann syndrome. the slc12a6 gene provides instructions for making a protein called a k-cl cotransporter. this protein is involved in moving charged atoms (ions) of potassium (k) and chlorine (cl) across the cell membrane. the positively charged potassium ions and negatively charged chlorine ions are moved together (cotransported), so that the charges inside and outside the cell membrane are unchanged (electroneutral). electroneutral cotransport of ions across cell membranes is involved in many functions of the body. while the specific function of the k-cl cotransporter produced from the slc12a6 gene is unknown, it seems to be critical for the development and maintenance of nerve tissue. it may be involved in regulating the amounts of potassium, chlorine, or water in cells and intercellular spaces. the k-cl cotransporter protein may also help regulate the activity of other proteins that are sensitive to ion concentrations. mutations in the slc12a6 gene that cause andermann syndrome disrupt the function of the k-cl cotransporter protein. the lack of functional protein normally produced from the slc12a6 gene is believed to interfere with the development of the corpus callosum and maintenance of the nerves that transmit signals needed for movement and sensation, resulting in the signs and symptoms of andermann syndrome."
"what are the genetic changes related to spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, strudwick type ?","spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, strudwick type is one of a spectrum of skeletal disorders caused by mutations in the col2a1 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms type ii collagen. this type of collagen is found mostly in the clear gel that fills the eyeball (the vitreous) and cartilage. cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. most cartilage is later converted to bone, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears. type ii collagen is essential for the normal development of bones and other connective tissues that form the body's supportive framework. most mutations in the col2a1 gene that cause spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, strudwick type interfere with the assembly of type ii collagen molecules. abnormal collagen prevents bones and other connective tissues from developing properly, which leads to the signs and symptoms of spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, strudwick type."

what are the genetic changes related to aniridia ?,"aniridia is caused by mutations in the pax6 gene. the pax6 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the early development of the eyes, brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), and the pancreas. within the brain, the pax6 protein is involved in the development of a specialized group of brain cells that process smell (the olfactory bulb). the pax6 protein attaches (binds) to specific regions of dna and regulates the activity of other genes. on the basis of this role, the pax6 protein is called a transcription factor. following birth, the pax6 protein regulates several genes that likely contribute to the maintenance of different eye structures. mutations in the pax6 gene result in the production of a nonfunctional pax6 protein that is unable to bind to dna and regulate the activity of other genes. a lack of functional pax6 protein disrupts the formation of the eyes during embryonic development."
is spastic paraplegia type 8 inherited ?,"spastic paraplegia type 8 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family."
how many people are affected by arginase deficiency ?,"arginase deficiency is a very rare disorder; it has been estimated to occur once in every 300,000 to 1,000,000 individuals."
what is (are) snyder-robinson syndrome ?,"snyder-robinson syndrome is a condition characterized by intellectual disability, muscle and bone abnormalities, and other problems with development. it occurs exclusively in males. males with snyder-robinson syndrome have delayed development and intellectual disability beginning in early childhood. the intellectual disability can range from mild to profound. speech often develops late, and speech difficulties are common. some affected individuals never develop any speech. most affected males are thin and have low muscle mass, a body type described as an asthenic habitus. weakness or ""floppiness"" (hypotonia) typically becomes apparent in infancy, and the loss of muscle tissue continues with age. people with this condition often have difficulty walking; most have an unsteady gait. snyder-robinson syndrome causes skeletal problems, particularly thinning of the bones (osteoporosis) that starts in early childhood. osteoporosis causes the bones to be brittle and to break easily, often during normal activities. in people with snyder-robinson syndrome, broken bones occur most often in the arms and legs. most affected individuals also develop an abnormal side-to-side and back-to-front curvature of the spine (scoliosis and kyphosis, often called kyphoscoliosis when they occur together). affected individuals tend to be shorter than their peers and others in their family. snyder-robinson syndrome is associated with distinctive facial features, including a prominent lower lip; a high, narrow roof of the mouth or an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate); and differences in the size and shape of the right and left sides of the face (facial asymmetry). other signs and symptoms that have been reported include seizures that begin in childhood and abnormalities of the genitalia and kidneys."
what is (are) deafness-dystonia-optic neuronopathy syndrome ?,"deafness-dystonia-optic neuronopathy (ddon) syndrome, also known as mohr-tranebjrg syndrome, is characterized by hearing loss that begins early in life, problems with movement, impaired vision, and behavior problems. this condition occurs almost exclusively in males. the first symptom of ddon syndrome is hearing loss caused by nerve damage in the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss), which begins in early childhood. the hearing impairment worsens over time, and most affected individuals have profound hearing loss by age 10. people with ddon syndrome typically begin to develop problems with movement during their teens, although the onset of these symptoms varies among affected individuals. some people experience involuntary tensing of the muscles (dystonia), while others have difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia). the problems with movement usually worsen over time. individuals with ddon syndrome have normal vision during childhood, but they may begin to develop an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia) or other vision problems during their teens. these people often have a slowly progressive reduction in the sharpness of vision (visual acuity) and become legally blind in mid-adulthood. people with this condition may also have behavior problems, including changes in personality and aggressive or paranoid behaviors. they also usually develop a gradual decline in thinking and reasoning abilities (dementia) in their forties. the lifespan of individuals with ddon syndrome depends on the severity of the disorder. people with severe cases have survived into their teenage years, while those with milder cases have lived into their sixties."
is deafness-dystonia-optic neuronopathy syndrome inherited ?,"ddon syndrome is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. the gene associated with this condition is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause ddon syndrome. because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by x-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. females who carry one altered copy of the timm8a gene are typically unaffected; however, they may develop mild hearing loss and dystonia. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons."
how many people are affected by troyer syndrome ?,about 20 cases of troyer syndrome have been reported in the old order amish population of ohio. it has not been found outside this population.
how many people are affected by wolf-hirschhorn syndrome ?,"the prevalence of wolf-hirschhorn syndrome is estimated to be 1 in 50,000 births. however, this may be an underestimate because it is likely that some affected individuals are never diagnosed. for unknown reasons, wolf-hirschhorn syndrome occurs in about twice as many females as males."
what are the genetic changes related to alternating hemiplegia of childhood ?,"alternating hemiplegia of childhood is primarily caused by mutations in the atp1a3 gene. very rarely, a mutation in the atp1a2 gene is involved in the condition. these genes provide instructions for making very similar proteins. they function as different forms of one piece, the alpha subunit, of a larger protein complex called na+/k+ atpase; the two versions of the complex are found in different parts of the brain. both versions play a critical role in the normal function of nerve cells (neurons). na+/k+ atpase transports charged atoms (ions) into and out of neurons, which is an essential part of the signaling process that controls muscle movement. mutations in the atp1a3 or atp1a2 gene reduce the activity of the na+/k+ atpase, impairing its ability to transport ions normally. it is unclear how a malfunctioning na+/k+ atpase causes the episodes of paralysis or uncontrollable movements characteristic of alternating hemiplegia of childhood."

what are the genetic changes related to ewing sarcoma ?,"the most common mutation that causes ewing sarcoma involves two genes, the ewsr1 gene on chromosome 22 and the fli1 gene on chromosome 11. a rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 22 and 11, written as t(11;22), fuses part of the ewsr1 gene with part of the fli1 gene, creating the ewsr1/fli1 fusion gene. this mutation is acquired during a person's lifetime and is present only in tumor cells. this type of genetic change, called a somatic mutation, is not inherited. the protein produced from the ewsr1/fli1 fusion gene, called ews/fli, has functions of the protein products of both genes. the fli protein, produced from the fli1 gene, attaches (binds) to dna and regulates an activity called transcription, which is the first step in the production of proteins from genes. the fli protein controls the growth and development of some cell types by regulating the transcription of certain genes. the ews protein, produced from the ewsr1 gene, also regulates transcription. the ews/fli protein has the dna-binding function of the fli protein as well as the transcription regulation function of the ews protein. it is thought that the ews/fli protein turns the transcription of a variety of genes on and off abnormally. this dysregulation of transcription leads to uncontrolled growth and division (proliferation) and abnormal maturation and survival of cells, causing tumor development. the ewsr1/fli1 fusion gene occurs in approximately 85 percent of ewing sarcomas. translocations that fuse the ewsr1 gene with other genes that are related to the fli1 gene can also cause these types of tumors, although these alternative translocations are relatively uncommon. the fusion proteins produced from the less common gene translocations have the same function as the ews/fli protein."
what are the genetic changes related to tay-sachs disease ?,"mutations in the hexa gene cause tay-sachs disease. the hexa gene provides instructions for making part of an enzyme called beta-hexosaminidase a, which plays a critical role in the brain and spinal cord. this enzyme is located in lysosomes, which are structures in cells that break down toxic substances and act as recycling centers. within lysosomes, beta-hexosaminidase a helps break down a fatty substance called gm2 ganglioside. mutations in the hexa gene disrupt the activity of beta-hexosaminidase a, which prevents the enzyme from breaking down gm2 ganglioside. as a result, this substance accumulates to toxic levels, particularly in neurons in the brain and spinal cord. progressive damage caused by the buildup of gm2 ganglioside leads to the destruction of these neurons, which causes the signs and symptoms of tay-sachs disease. because tay-sachs disease impairs the function of a lysosomal enzyme and involves the buildup of gm2 ganglioside, this condition is sometimes referred to as a lysosomal storage disorder or a gm2-gangliosidosis."

what is (are) beta thalassemia ?,"beta thalassemia is a blood disorder that reduces the production of hemoglobin. hemoglobin is the iron-containing protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells throughout the body. in people with beta thalassemia, low levels of hemoglobin lead to a lack of oxygen in many parts of the body. affected individuals also have a shortage of red blood cells (anemia), which can cause pale skin, weakness, fatigue, and more serious complications. people with beta thalassemia are at an increased risk of developing abnormal blood clots. beta thalassemia is classified into two types depending on the severity of symptoms: thalassemia major (also known as cooley's anemia) and thalassemia intermedia. of the two types, thalassemia major is more severe. the signs and symptoms of thalassemia major appear within the first 2 years of life. children develop life-threatening anemia. they do not gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive) and may develop yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). affected individuals may have an enlarged spleen, liver, and heart, and their bones may be misshapen. some adolescents with thalassemia major experience delayed puberty. many people with thalassemia major have such severe symptoms that they need frequent blood transfusions to replenish their red blood cell supply. over time, an influx of iron-containing hemoglobin from chronic blood transfusions can lead to a buildup of iron in the body, resulting in liver, heart, and hormone problems. thalassemia intermedia is milder than thalassemia major. the signs and symptoms of thalassemia intermedia appear in early childhood or later in life. affected individuals have mild to moderate anemia and may also have slow growth and bone abnormalities."
is beta thalassemia inherited ?,"thalassemia major and thalassemia intermedia are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the hbb gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. sometimes, however, people with only one hbb gene mutation in each cell develop mild anemia. these mildly affected people are said to have thalassemia minor. in a small percentage of families, the hbb gene mutation is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. in these cases, one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the signs and symptoms of beta thalassemia."

what is (are) short qt syndrome ?,"short qt syndrome is a condition that can cause a disruption of the heart's normal rhythm (arrhythmia). in people with this condition, the heart (cardiac) muscle takes less time than usual to recharge between beats. the term ""short qt"" refers to a specific pattern of heart activity that is detected with an electrocardiogram (ekg), which is a test used to measure the electrical activity of the heart. in people with this condition, the part of the heartbeat known as the qt interval is abnormally short. if untreated, the arrhythmia associated with short qt syndrome can lead to a variety of signs and symptoms, from dizziness and fainting (syncope) to cardiac arrest and sudden death. these signs and symptoms can occur any time from early infancy to old age. this condition may explain some cases of sudden infant death syndrome (sids), which is a major cause of unexplained death in babies younger than 1 year. however, some people with short qt syndrome never experience any health problems associated with the condition."

how many people are affected by 1q21.1 microdeletion ?,1q21.1 microdeletion is a rare chromosomal change; only a few dozen individuals with this deletion have been reported in the medical literature.
what is (are) glucose-galactose malabsorption ?,"glucose-galactose malabsorption is a condition in which the cells lining the intestine cannot take in the sugars glucose and galactose, which prevents proper digestion of these molecules and larger molecules made from them. glucose and galactose are called simple sugars, or monosaccharides. sucrose (table sugar) and lactose (the sugar found in milk) are called disaccharides because they are made from two simple sugars, and are broken down into these simple sugars during digestion. sucrose is broken down into glucose and another simple sugar called fructose, and lactose is broken down into glucose and galactose. as a result, lactose, sucrose and other compounds made from sugar molecules (carbohydrates) cannot be digested by individuals with glucose-galactose malabsorption. glucose-galactose malabsorption generally becomes apparent in the first few weeks of a baby's life. affected infants experience severe diarrhea resulting in life-threatening dehydration, increased acidity of the blood and tissues (acidosis), and weight loss when fed breast milk or regular infant formulas. however, they are able to digest fructose-based formulas that do not contain glucose or galactose. some affected children are better able to tolerate glucose and galactose as they get older. small amounts of glucose in the urine (mild glucosuria) may occur intermittently in this disorder. affected individuals may also develop kidney stones or more widespread deposits of calcium within the kidneys."
is mandibulofacial dysostosis with microcephaly inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. most cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. in other cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from a parent. the parent may be mildly affected or may be unaffected. sometimes the parent has the gene mutation only in some or all of their sperm or egg cells, which is known as germline mosaicism. in these cases, the parent has no signs or symptoms of the condition."
what are the genetic changes related to craniofacial microsomia ?,"it is unclear what genes are involved in craniofacial microsomia. this condition results from problems in the development of structures in the embryo called the first and second pharyngeal arches (also called branchial or visceral arches). tissue layers in the six pairs of pharyngeal arches give rise to the muscles, arteries, nerves, and cartilage of the face and neck. specifically, the first and second pharyngeal arches develop into the lower jaw, the nerves and muscles used for chewing and facial expression, the external ear, and the bones of the middle ear. interference with the normal development of these structures can result in the abnormalities characteristic of craniofacial microsomia. there are several factors that can disrupt the normal development of the first and second pharyngeal arches and lead to craniofacial microsomia. some individuals with this condition have chromosomal abnormalities such as deletions or duplications of genetic material; these individuals often have additional developmental problems or malformations. occasionally, craniofacial microsomia occurs in multiple members of a family in a pattern that suggests inheritance of a causative gene mutation, but the gene or genes involved are unknown. in other families, individuals seem to inherit a predisposition to the disorder. the risk of craniofacial microsomia can also be increased by environmental factors, such as certain drugs taken by the mother during pregnancy. in most affected individuals, the cause of the disorder is unknown. it is not well understood why certain disruptions to development affect the first and second pharyngeal arches in particular. researchers suggest that these structures may develop together in such a way that they respond as a unit to these disruptions."
is branchio-oculo-facial syndrome inherited ?,"branchio-oculo-facial syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in about half of cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. the remaining cases occur in people whose parents do not have a mutation in the tfap2a gene. in these situations, the mutation likely occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) in a parent or in early fetal development of the affected individual."

what are the genetic changes related to klippel-feil syndrome ?,"mutations in the gdf6, gdf3, or meox1 gene can cause klippel-feil syndrome. these genes are involved in proper bone development. the protein produced from the gdf6 gene is necessary for the formation of bones and joints, including those in the spine. while the protein produced from the gdf3 gene is known to be involved in bone development, its exact role is unclear. the protein produced from the meox1 gene, called homeobox protein mox-1, regulates the process that begins separating vertebrae from one another during early development. gdf6 and gdf3 gene mutations that cause klippel-feil syndrome likely lead to reduced function of the respective proteins. meox1 gene mutations lead to a complete lack of homeobox protein mox-1. although the gdf6, gdf3, and homeobox protein mox-1 proteins are involved in bone development, particularly formation of vertebrae, it is unclear how a shortage of one of these proteins leads to incomplete separation of the cervical vertebrae in people with klippel-feil syndrome. when klippel-feil syndrome is a feature of another disorder, it is caused by mutations in genes involved in the other disorder."
"what are the genetic changes related to 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency ?","17-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency is caused by mutations in the cyp17a1 gene. the protein produced from this gene is involved in the formation of steroid hormones. this group of hormones includes sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogen, which are needed for normal sexual development and reproduction; mineralocorticoids, which help regulate the body's salt and water balance; and glucocorticoids, which are involved in maintaining blood sugar levels and regulating the body's response to stress. steroid hormones are produced through a series of chemical reactions. the cyp17a1 enzyme performs two important reactions in this process. the enzyme has 17 alpha()-hydroxylase activity, which is important for production of glucocorticoids and sex hormones. cyp17a1 also has 17,20-lyase activity, which is integral to the production of sex hormones. 17-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency results from a shortage (deficiency) of both enzyme activities. the amount of remaining enzyme activity determines whether a person will have the complete or partial form of the disorder. individuals with the complete form have cyp17a1 gene mutations that result in the production of an enzyme with very little or no 17-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activity. people with the partial form of this condition have cyp17a1 gene mutations that allow some enzyme activity, although at reduced levels. with little or no 17-hydroxylase activity, production of glucocorticoids is impaired, and instead, mineralocorticoids are produced. an excess of these salt-regulating hormones leads to hypertension and hypokalemia. loss of 17,20-lyase activity impairs sex hormone production. shortage of these hormones disrupts development of the reproductive system and impairs the onset of puberty in males and females with 17-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency."
"is 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency inherited ?","this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."

what is (are) nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly ?,"nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly is an abnormality of brain development that also affects the head and face. normally, the brain divides into two halves (hemispheres) during early development. holoprosencephaly occurs when the brain fails to divide properly into the right and left hemispheres. this condition is called nonsyndromic to distinguish it from other types of holoprosencephaly caused by genetic syndromes, chromosome abnormalities, or substances that cause birth defects (teratogens). the severity of nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly varies widely among affected individuals, even within the same family. nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly can be grouped into four types according to the degree of brain division. from most to least severe, the types are known as alobar, semi-lobar, lobar, and middle interhemispheric variant (mihv). in the most severe forms of nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly, the brain does not divide at all. these affected individuals have one central eye (cyclopia) and a tubular nasal structure (proboscis) located above the eye. most babies with severe nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly die before birth or soon after. in the less severe forms, the brain is partially divided and the eyes are usually set close together (hypotelorism). the life expectancy of these affected individuals varies depending on the severity of symptoms. people with nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly often have a small head (microcephaly), although they can develop a buildup of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus) that causes increased head size (macrocephaly). other features may include an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) with or without a split in the upper lip (cleft lip), one central front tooth instead of two (a single maxillary central incisor), and a flat nasal bridge. the eyeballs may be abnormally small (microphthalmia) or absent (anophthalmia). some individuals with nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly have a distinctive pattern of facial features, including a narrowing of the head at the temples, outside corners of the eyes that point upward (upslanting palpebral fissures), large ears, a short nose with upturned nostrils, and a broad and deep space between the nose and mouth (philtrum). in general, the severity of facial features is directly related to the severity of the brain abnormalities. however, individuals with mildly affected facial features can have severe brain abnormalities. some people do not have apparent structural brain abnormalities but have some of the facial features associated with this condition. these individuals are considered to have a form of the disorder known as microform holoprosencephaly and are typically identified after the birth of a severely affected family member. most people with nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly have developmental delay and intellectual disability. affected individuals also frequently have a malfunctioning pituitary gland, which is a gland located at the base of the brain that produces several hormones. because pituitary dysfunction leads to the partial or complete absence of these hormones, it can cause a variety of disorders. most commonly, people with nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly and pituitary dysfunction develop diabetes insipidus, a condition that disrupts the balance between fluid intake and urine excretion. dysfunction in other parts of the brain can cause seizures, feeding difficulties, and problems regulating body temperature, heart rate, and breathing. the sense of smell may be diminished (hyposmia) or completely absent (anosmia) if the part of the brain that processes smells is underdeveloped or missing."

what are the genetic changes related to lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy ?,"lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy can be caused by mutations in either the epm2a gene or the nhlrc1 gene. these genes provide instructions for making proteins called laforin and malin, respectively. laforin and malin play a critical role in the survival of nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. studies suggest that laforin and malin work together and may have several functions. one of these is to help regulate the production of a complex sugar called glycogen, which is a major source of stored energy in the body. the body stores this sugar in the liver and muscles, breaking it down when it is needed for fuel. laforin and malin may prevent a potentially damaging buildup of glycogen in tissues that do not normally store this molecule, such as those of the nervous system. researchers have discovered that people with lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy have distinctive clumps called lafora bodies within their cells. lafora bodies are made up of an abnormal form of glycogen that cannot be broken down and used for fuel. instead, it builds up to form clumps that can damage cells. neurons appear to be particularly vulnerable to this type of damage. although lafora bodies are found in many of the body's tissues, the signs and symptoms of lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy are limited to the nervous system. mutations in the epm2a gene prevent cells from making functional laforin, while nhlrc1 gene mutations prevent the production of functional malin. it is unclear how a loss of either of these proteins leads to the formation of lafora bodies. however, a loss of laforin or malin ultimately results in the death of neurons, which interferes with the brain's normal functions. the condition tends to progress more slowly in some people with nhlrc1 gene mutations than in those with epm2a gene mutations. mutations in the epm2a and nhlrc1 genes account for 80 percent to 90 percent of all cases of lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy. in the remaining cases, the cause of the condition is unknown. researchers are searching for other genetic changes that may underlie this disease."

how many people are affected by familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection ?,"familial taad is believed to account for at least 20 percent of thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections. in the remainder of cases, the abnormalities are thought to be caused by factors that are not inherited, such as damage to the walls of the aorta from aging, tobacco use, injury, or disease. while aortic aneurysms are common worldwide, it is difficult to determine their exact prevalence because they usually cause no symptoms unless they rupture. ruptured aortic aneurysms and dissections are estimated to cause almost 30,000 deaths in the united states each year."
what are the genetic changes related to familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection ?,"mutations in any of several genes are associated with familial taad. mutations in the acta2 gene have been identified in 14 to 20 percent of people with this disorder, and tgfbr2 gene mutations have been found in 2.5 percent of affected individuals. mutations in several other genes account for smaller percentages of cases. the acta2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called smooth muscle alpha ()-2 actin, which is found in vascular smooth muscle cells. layers of these cells are found in the walls of the aorta and other arteries. within vascular smooth muscle cells, smooth muscle -2 actin forms the core of structures called sarcomeres, which are necessary for muscles to contract. this ability to contract allows the arteries to maintain their shape instead of stretching out as blood is pumped through them. acta2 gene mutations that are associated with familial taad change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the smooth muscle -2 actin protein. these changes likely affect the way the protein functions in smooth muscle contraction, interfering with the sarcomeres' ability to prevent the arteries from stretching. the aorta, where the force of blood pumped directly from the heart is most intense, is particularly vulnerable to this stretching. abnormal stretching of the aorta results in the aortic dilatation, aneurysms, and dissections that characterize familial taad. tgfbr2 gene mutations are also associated with familial taad. the tgfbr2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-) receptor type 2. this receptor transmits signals from the cell surface into the cell through a process called signal transduction. through this type of signaling, the environment outside the cell affects activities inside the cell. in particular, the tgf- receptor type 2 protein helps control the growth and division (proliferation) of cells and the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation). it is also involved in the formation of the extracellular matrix, an intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells. tgfbr2 gene mutations alter the receptor's structure, which disturbs signal transduction. the disturbed signaling can impair cell growth and development. it is not known how these changes result in the specific aortic abnormalities associated with familial taad. mutations in other genes, some of which have not been identified, are also associated with familial taad."
is familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection inherited ?,"familial taad is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell can be sufficient to cause the condition. in most cases, an affected person has one affected parent. however, some people who inherit an altered gene never develop the aortic abnormalities associated with the condition; this situation is known as reduced penetrance."

what is (are) osteopetrosis ?,"osteopetrosis is a bone disease that makes bones abnormally dense and prone to breakage (fracture). researchers have described several major types of osteopetrosis, which are usually distinguished by their pattern of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or x-linked. the different types of the disorder can also be distinguished by the severity of their signs and symptoms. autosomal dominant osteopetrosis (ado), which is also called albers-schnberg disease, is typically the mildest type of the disorder. some affected individuals have no symptoms. in these people, the unusually dense bones may be discovered by accident when an x-ray is done for another reason. in affected individuals who develop signs and symptoms, the major features of the condition include multiple bone fractures, abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis) or other spinal abnormalities, arthritis in the hips, and a bone infection called osteomyelitis. these problems usually become apparent in late childhood or adolescence. autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (aro) is a more severe form of the disorder that becomes apparent in early infancy. affected individuals have a high risk of bone fracture resulting from seemingly minor bumps and falls. their abnormally dense skull bones pinch nerves in the head and face (cranial nerves), often resulting in vision loss, hearing loss, and paralysis of facial muscles. dense bones can also impair the function of bone marrow, preventing it from producing new blood cells and immune system cells. as a result, people with severe osteopetrosis are at risk of abnormal bleeding, a shortage of red blood cells (anemia), and recurrent infections. in the most severe cases, these bone marrow abnormalities can be life-threatening in infancy or early childhood. other features of autosomal recessive osteopetrosis can include slow growth and short stature, dental abnormalities, and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). depending on the genetic changes involved, people with severe osteopetrosis can also have brain abnormalities, intellectual disability, or recurrent seizures (epilepsy). a few individuals have been diagnosed with intermediate autosomal osteopetrosis (iao), a form of the disorder that can have either an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. the signs and symptoms of this condition become noticeable in childhood and include an increased risk of bone fracture and anemia. people with this form of the disorder typically do not have life-threatening bone marrow abnormalities. however, some affected individuals have had abnormal calcium deposits (calcifications) in the brain, intellectual disability, and a form of kidney disease called renal tubular acidosis. rarely, osteopetrosis can have an x-linked pattern of inheritance. in addition to abnormally dense bones, the x-linked form of the disorder is characterized by abnormal swelling caused by a buildup of fluid (lymphedema) and a condition called anhydrotic ectodermal dysplasia that affects the skin, hair, teeth, and sweat glands. affected individuals also have a malfunctioning immune system (immunodeficiency), which allows severe, recurrent infections to develop. researchers often refer to this condition as ol-eda-id, an acronym derived from each of the major features of the disorder."
is osteopetrosis inherited ?,"osteopetrosis can have several different patterns of inheritance. most commonly, the disorder has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. most people with autosomal dominant osteopetrosis inherit the condition from an affected parent. osteopetrosis can also be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of a gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. ol-eda-id is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. the ikbkg gene is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by x-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons."
what is (are) leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 ?,"leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 is a disorder that causes the immune system to malfunction, resulting in a form of immunodeficiency. immunodeficiencies are conditions in which the immune system is not able to protect the body effectively from foreign invaders such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi. starting from birth, people with leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 develop serious bacterial and fungal infections. one of the first signs of leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 is a delay in the detachment of the umbilical cord stump after birth. in newborns, the stump normally falls off within the first two weeks of life; but, in infants with leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1, this separation usually occurs at three weeks or later. in addition, affected infants often have inflammation of the umbilical cord stump (omphalitis) due to a bacterial infection. in leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1, bacterial and fungal infections most commonly occur on the skin and mucous membranes such as the moist lining of the nose and mouth. in childhood, people with this condition develop severe inflammation of the gums (gingivitis) and other tissue around the teeth (periodontitis), which often results in the loss of both primary and permanent teeth. these infections often spread to cover a large area. a hallmark of leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 is the lack of pus formation at the sites of infection. in people with this condition, wounds are slow to heal, which can lead to additional infection. life expectancy in individuals with leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 is often severely shortened. due to repeat infections, affected individuals may not survive past infancy."
is leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
is charcot-marie-tooth disease inherited ?,"the pattern of inheritance varies with the type of charcot-marie-tooth disease. cmt1, most cases of cmt2, and most intermediate forms are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. this pattern of inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in most cases, an affected person has one affected parent. cmt4, a few cmt2 subtypes, and some intermediate forms are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. cmtx is inherited in an x-linked dominant pattern. a condition is considered x-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the x chromosome. the inheritance is dominant if one copy of the altered gene is sufficient to cause the condition. in most cases, affected males, who have the alteration on their only copy of the x chromosome, experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females, who have two x chromosomes. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons. all daughters of affected men will have one altered x chromosome, but they may only have mild symptoms of the disorder. some cases of charcot-marie-tooth disease result from a new mutation and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family."
how many people are affected by griscelli syndrome ?,griscelli syndrome is a rare condition; its prevalence is unknown. type 2 appears to be the most common of the three known types.
what are the genetic changes related to griscelli syndrome ?,"the three types of griscelli syndrome are caused by mutations in different genes: type 1 results from mutations in the myo5a gene, type 2 is caused by mutations in the rab27a gene, and type 3 results from mutations in the mlph gene. the proteins produced from these genes are found in pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. within these cells, the proteins work together to transport structures called melanosomes. these structures produce a pigment called melanin, which is the substance that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color (pigmentation). melanosomes are formed near the center of melanocytes, but they must be transported to the outer edge of these cells and then transferred into other types of cells to provide normal pigmentation. mutations in any of the three genes, myo5a, rab27a, or mlph, impair the normal transport of melanosomes within melanocytes. as a result, these structures clump near the center of melanocytes, trapping melanin within these cells and preventing normal pigmentation of skin and hair. the clumps of pigment, which can be seen in hair shafts when viewed under a microscope, are a hallmark feature of the condition. in addition to their roles in melanosome transport, the myo5a and rab27a genes have functions elsewhere in the body. specifically, the protein produced from the myo5a gene transports materials within nerve cells (neurons) that appear to be critical for cell function. the protein produced from the rab27a gene is found in immune system cells, where it is involved in the release of certain compounds that kill foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). mutations in these genes impair these critical cell activities, leading to the neurological problems and immune system abnormalities found in griscelli syndrome types 1 and 2, respectively."

how many people are affected by junctional epidermolysis bullosa ?,"both types of junctional epidermolysis bullosa are rare, affecting fewer than 1 per million people in the united states."
what is (are) familial erythrocytosis ?,"familial erythrocytosis is an inherited condition characterized by an increased number of red blood cells (erythrocytes). the primary function of these cells is to carry oxygen from the lungs to tissues and organs throughout the body. signs and symptoms of familial erythrocytosis can include headaches, dizziness, nosebleeds, and shortness of breath. the excess red blood cells also increase the risk of developing abnormal blood clots that can block the flow of blood through arteries and veins. if these clots restrict blood flow to essential organs and tissues (particularly the heart, lungs, or brain), they can cause life-threatening complications such as a heart attack or stroke. however, many people with familial erythrocytosis experience only mild signs and symptoms or never have any problems related to their extra red blood cells."
how many people are affected by rippling muscle disease ?,the prevalence of rippling muscle disease is unknown.
what are the genetic changes related to hypokalemic periodic paralysis ?,"mutations in the cacna1s and scn4a genes cause hypokalemic periodic paralysis. the cacna1s and scn4a genes provide instructions for making proteins that play an essential role in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). for the body to move normally, these muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. muscle contractions are triggered by the flow of certain positively charged atoms (ions) into muscle cells. the cacna1s and scn4a proteins form channels that control the flow of these ions. the channel formed by the cacna1s protein transports calcium ions into cells, while the channel formed by the scn4a protein transports sodium ions. mutations in the cacna1s or scn4a gene alter the usual structure and function of calcium or sodium channels. the altered channels cannot properly regulate the flow of ions into muscle cells, which reduces the ability of skeletal muscles to contract. because muscle contraction is needed for movement, a disruption in normal ion transport leads to episodes of severe muscle weakness or paralysis. a small percentage of people with the characteristic features of hypokalemic periodic paralysis do not have identified mutations in the cacna1s or scn4a gene. in these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown."
what are the genetic changes related to adermatoglyphia ?,"adermatoglyphia is caused by mutations in the smarcad1 gene. this gene provides information for making two versions of the smarcad1 protein: a full-length version that is active (expressed) in multiple tissues and a shorter version that is expressed only in the skin. studies suggest that the full-length smarcad1 protein regulates the activity of a wide variety of genes involved in maintaining the stability of cells' genetic information. little is known about the function of the skin-specific version of the smarcad1 protein, but it appears to play a critical role in dermatoglyph formation. dermatoglyphs develop before birth and remain the same throughout life. the activity of this protein is likely one of several factors that determine each person's unique fingerprint pattern. the smarcad1 gene mutations that cause adermatoglyphia affect only the skin-specific version of the smarcad1 protein. these mutations reduce the total amount of this protein available in skin cells. although it is unclear how these genetic changes cause adermatoglyphia, researchers speculate that a shortage of the skin-specific version of the smarcad1 protein impairs signaling pathways needed for normal skin development and function, including the formation of dermatoglyphs."

what is (are) multiple sclerosis ?,"multiple sclerosis is a condition characterized by areas of damage (lesions) on the brain and spinal cord. these lesions are associated with destruction of the covering that protects nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses (the myelin sheath) and damage to nerve cells. multiple sclerosis is considered an autoimmune disorder; autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs, in this case tissues of the nervous system. multiple sclerosis usually begins in early adulthood, between ages 20 and 40. the symptoms vary widely, and affected individuals can experience one or more effects of nervous system damage. multiple sclerosis often causes sensory disturbances in the limbs, including a prickling or tingling sensation (paresthesia), numbness, pain, and itching. some people experience lhermitte sign, which is an electrical shock-like sensation that runs down the back and into the limbs. this sensation usually occurs when the head is bent forward. problems with muscle control are common in people with multiple sclerosis. affected individuals may have tremors, muscle stiffness (spasticity), exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia), weakness or partial paralysis of the muscles of the limbs, difficulty walking, or poor bladder control. multiple sclerosis is also associated with vision problems, such as blurred or double vision or partial or complete vision loss. infections that cause fever can make the symptoms worse. there are several forms of multiple sclerosis: relapsing-remitting ms, secondary progressive ms, primary progressive ms, and progressive relapsing ms. the most common is the relapsing-remitting form, which affects approximately 80 percent of people with multiple sclerosis. individuals with this form of the condition have periods during which they experience symptoms, called clinical attacks, followed by periods without any symptoms (remission). the triggers of clinical attacks and remissions are unknown. after about 10 years, relapsing-remitting ms usually develops into another form of the disorder called secondary progressive ms. in this form, there are no remissions, and symptoms of the condition continually worsen. primary progressive ms is the next most common form, affecting approximately 10 to 20 percent of people with multiple sclerosis. this form is characterized by constant symptoms that worsen over time, with no clinical attacks or remissions. primary progressive ms typically begins later than the other forms, around age 40. progressive relapsing ms is a rare form of multiple sclerosis that initially appears like primary progressive ms, with constant symptoms. however, people with progressive relapsing ms also experience clinical attacks of more severe symptoms."
what are the genetic changes related to stevens-johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis ?,"several genetic changes have been found to increase the risk of sjs/ten in response to triggering factors such as medications. most of these changes occur in genes that are involved in the normal function of the immune system. the genetic variations most strongly associated with sjs/ten occur in the hla-b gene. this gene is part of a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (hla) complex. the hla complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). the hla-b gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. certain variations in this gene occur much more often in people with sjs/ten than in people without the condition. studies suggest that the hla-b gene variations associated with sjs/ten cause the immune system to react abnormally to certain medications. in a process that is not well understood, the drug causes immune cells called cytotoxic t cells and natural killer (nk) cells to release a substance called granulysin that destroys cells in the skin and mucous membranes. the death of these cells causes the blistering and peeling that is characteristic of sjs/ten. variations in several other hla and non-hla genes have also been studied as potential risk factors for sjs/ten. however, most people with genetic variations that increase the risk of sjs/ten never develop the disease, even if they are exposed to drugs that can trigger it. researchers believe that additional genetic and nongenetic factors, many of which are unknown, likely play a role in whether a particular individual develops sjs/ten. the drugs most frequently associated with sjs/ten include several medications that are used to treat seizures (particularly carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenytoin); allopurinol, which is used to treat kidney stones and a form of arthritis called gout; a class of antibiotic drugs called sulfonamides; nevirapine, which is used to treat hiv infection; and a type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) called oxicams. other factors may also trigger sjs/ten. in particular, these skin reactions have occurred in people with an unusual form of pneumonia caused by infection with mycoplasma pneumoniae and in people with viral infections, including cytomegalovirus. researchers suspect that a combination of infections and drugs could contribute to the disease in some individuals. in many cases, no definitive trigger for an individual's sjs/ten is ever discovered."

what are the genetic changes related to adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency ?,"mutations in the ampd1 gene cause amp deaminase deficiency. the ampd1 gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called amp deaminase. this enzyme is found in skeletal muscle, where it plays a role in producing energy within muscle cells. mutations in the ampd1 gene disrupt the function of amp deaminase and impair the muscle cells' ability to produce energy. this lack of energy can lead to myalgia or other muscle problems associated with amp deaminase deficiency. the three types of amp deaminase deficiency are known as the inherited type, acquired type, and coincidental inherited type. individuals with the inherited type have a mutation in both copies of the ampd1 gene in each cell. most people are asymptomatic, meaning they have no symptoms. some people with amp deaminase deficiency experience muscle weakness or pain following exercise. the acquired type occurs in people who have decreased levels of amp deaminase due to the presence of a muscle or joint condition. people with the coincidental inherited type have a mutation in both copies of the ampd1 gene. additionally, they have a separate joint or muscle disorder. some individuals experience more severe joint or muscle symptoms related to their disorder if they have amp deaminase deficiency than do people without this enzyme deficiency. most, however, do not have any symptoms associated with amp deaminase deficiency. it is not known why most people with this condition do not experience symptoms. researchers speculate that additional mutations in other genes may be involved."
what is (are) vitiligo ?,"vitiligo is a condition that causes patchy loss of skin coloring (pigmentation). the average age of onset of vitiligo is in the mid-twenties, but it can appear at any age. it tends to progress over time, with larger areas of the skin losing pigment. some people with vitiligo also have patches of pigment loss affecting the hair on their scalp or body. researchers have identified several forms of vitiligo. generalized vitiligo (also called nonsegmental vitiligo), which is the most common form, involves loss of pigment (depigmentation) in patches of skin all over the body. depigmentation typically occurs on the face, neck, and scalp, and around body openings such as the mouth and genitals. sometimes pigment is lost in mucous membranes, such as the lips. loss of pigmentation is also frequently seen in areas that tend to experience rubbing, impact, or other trauma, such as the hands, arms, and places where bones are close to the skin surface (bony prominences). another form called segmental vitiligo is associated with smaller patches of depigmented skin that appear on one side of the body in a limited area; this occurs in about 10 percent of affected individuals. vitiligo is generally considered to be an autoimmune disorder. autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. in people with vitiligo the immune system appears to attack the pigment cells (melanocytes) in the skin. about 15 to 25 percent of people with vitiligo are also affected by at least one other autoimmune disorder, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, psoriasis, pernicious anemia, addison disease, or systemic lupus erythematosus. in the absence of other autoimmune conditions, vitiligo does not affect general health or physical functioning. however, concerns about appearance and ethnic identity are significant issues for many affected individuals."

what is (are) autosomal recessive axonal neuropathy with neuromyotonia ?,"autosomal recessive axonal neuropathy with neuromyotonia is a disorder that affects the peripheral nerves. peripheral nerves connect the brain and spinal cord to muscles and to sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch, pain, heat, and sound. axonal neuropathy, a characteristic feature of this condition, is caused by damage to a particular part of peripheral nerves called axons, which are the extensions of nerve cells (neurons) that transmit nerve impulses. in people with autosomal recessive axonal neuropathy with neuromyotonia, the damage primarily causes progressive weakness and wasting (atrophy) of muscles in the feet, legs, and hands. muscle weakness may be especially apparent during exercise (exercise intolerance) and can lead to an unusual walking style (gait), frequent falls, and joint deformities (contractures) in the hands and feet. in some affected individuals, axonal neuropathy also causes decreased sensitivity to touch, heat, or cold, particularly in the lower arms or legs. another feature of this condition is neuromyotonia (also known as isaac syndrome). neuromyotonia results from overactivation (hyperexcitability) of peripheral nerves, which leads to delayed relaxation of muscles after voluntary tensing (contraction), muscle cramps, and involuntary rippling movement of the muscles (myokymia)."
what are the genetic changes related to autosomal recessive axonal neuropathy with neuromyotonia ?,"autosomal recessive axonal neuropathy with neuromyotonia is caused by mutations in the hint1 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the function of the nervous system; however its specific role is not well understood. laboratory studies show that the hint1 protein has the ability to carry out a chemical reaction called hydrolysis that breaks down certain molecules; however, it is not known what effects the reaction has in the body. hint1 gene mutations that cause autosomal recessive axonal neuropathy with neuromyotonia lead to production of a hint1 protein with little or no function. sometimes the abnormal protein is broken down prematurely. researchers are working to determine how loss of functional hint1 protein affects the peripheral nerves and leads to the signs and symptoms of this condition."
what is (are) bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome ?,"bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by a large head size (macrocephaly), multiple noncancerous tumors and tumor-like growths called hamartomas, and dark freckles on the penis in males. the signs and symptoms of bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome are present from birth or become apparent in early childhood. at least half of affected infants have macrocephaly, and many also have a high birth weight and a large body size (macrosomia). growth usually slows during childhood, so affected adults are of normal height and body size. about half of all children with bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome have intellectual disability or delayed development, particularly the development of speech and of motor skills such as sitting, crawling, and walking. these delays may improve with age. about half of all people with bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome develop hamartomas in their intestines, known as hamartomatous polyps. other noncancerous growths often associated with bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome include fatty tumors called lipomas and angiolipomas that develop under the skin. some affected individuals also develop hemangiomas, which are red or purplish growths that consist of tangles of abnormal blood vessels. people with bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome may also have an increased risk of developing certain cancers, although researchers are still working to determine the cancer risks associated with this condition. other signs and symptoms that have been reported in people with bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome include weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and other muscle abnormalities, thyroid problems, and seizures. skeletal abnormalities have also been described with this condition, including an unusually large range of joint movement (hyperextensibility), abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis), and a sunken chest (pectus excavatum). the features of bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome overlap with those of another disorder called cowden syndrome. people with cowden syndrome develop hamartomas and other noncancerous growths; they also have an increased risk of developing certain types of cancer. both conditions can be caused by mutations in the pten gene. some people with bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome have had relatives diagnosed with cowden syndrome, and other individuals have had the characteristic features of both conditions. based on these similarities, researchers have proposed that bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome and cowden syndrome represent a spectrum of overlapping features known as pten hamartoma tumor syndrome instead of two distinct conditions."
how many people are affected by mecp2-related severe neonatal encephalopathy ?,mecp2-related severe neonatal encephalopathy is likely a rare condition. twenty to 30 affected males have been reported in the scientific literature.
is mecp2-related severe neonatal encephalopathy inherited ?,"mecp2-related severe neonatal encephalopathy has an x-linked pattern of inheritance. a condition is considered x-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the x chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes in each cell. in males, who have only one x chromosome, a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females, who have two x chromosomes, a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is usually sufficient to cause the condition. however, females with a mutation in the mecp2 gene do not develop mecp2-related severe neonatal encephalopathy. instead, they typically develop rett syndrome, which has signs and symptoms that include intellectual disability, seizures, and movement problems. in some cases, males with mecp2-related severe neonatal encephalopathy inherit the mutation from a mother with mild neurological problems or from a mother with no features related to the mutation. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons. other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family."
what is (are) protein s deficiency ?,"protein s deficiency is a disorder of blood clotting. people with this condition have an increased risk of developing abnormal blood clots. individuals with mild protein s deficiency are at risk of a type of clot called a deep vein thrombosis (dvt) that occurs in the deep veins of the arms or legs. if a dvt travels through the bloodstream and lodges in the lungs, it can cause a life-threatening clot known as a pulmonary embolism (pe). other factors can raise the risk of abnormal blood clots in people with mild protein s deficiency. these factors include increasing age, surgery, immobility, or pregnancy. the combination of protein s deficiency and other inherited disorders of blood clotting can also influence risk. many people with mild protein s deficiency never develop an abnormal blood clot, however. in severe cases of protein s deficiency, infants develop a life-threatening blood clotting disorder called purpura fulminans soon after birth. purpura fulminans is characterized by the formation of blood clots within small blood vessels throughout the body. these blood clots disrupt normal blood flow and can lead to death of body tissue (necrosis). widespread blood clotting uses up all available blood clotting proteins. as a result, abnormal bleeding occurs in various parts of the body and is often noticeable as large, purple skin lesions. individuals who survive the newborn period may experience recurrent episodes of purpura fulminans."
what are the genetic changes related to protein s deficiency ?,"protein s deficiency is caused by mutations in the pros1 gene. this gene provides instructions for making protein s, which is found in the bloodstream and is important for controlling blood clotting. protein s helps block the activity of (inactivate) certain proteins that promote the formation of blood clots. most mutations that cause protein s deficiency change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in protein s, which disrupts its ability to control blood clotting. individuals with this condition do not have enough functional protein s to inactivate clotting proteins, which results in the increased risk of developing abnormal blood clots. protein s deficiency can be divided into types i, ii and iii based on how mutations in the pros1 gene affect protein s."
what is (are) pontocerebellar hypoplasia ?,"pontocerebellar hypoplasia is a group of related conditions that affect the development of the brain. the term ""pontocerebellar"" refers to the pons and the cerebellum, which are the brain structures that are most severely affected in many forms of this disorder. the pons is located at the base of the brain in an area called the brainstem, where it transmits signals between the cerebellum and the rest of the brain. the cerebellum, which is located at the back of the brain, normally coordinates movement. the term ""hypoplasia"" refers to the underdevelopment of these brain regions. pontocerebellar hypoplasia also causes impaired growth of other parts of the brain, leading to an unusually small head size (microcephaly). this microcephaly is usually not apparent at birth but becomes noticeable as brain growth continues to be slow in infancy and early childhood. researchers have described at least ten types of pontocerebellar hypoplasia. all forms of this condition are characterized by impaired brain development, delayed development overall, problems with movement, and intellectual disability. the brain abnormalities are usually present at birth, and in some cases they can be detected before birth. many children with pontocerebellar hypoplasia live only into infancy or childhood, although some affected individuals have lived into adulthood. the two major forms of pontocerebellar hypoplasia are designated as type 1 (pch1) and type 2 (pch2). in addition to the brain abnormalities described above, pch1 causes problems with muscle movement resulting from a loss of specialized nerve cells called motor neurons in the spinal cord, similar to another genetic disorder known as spinal muscular atrophy. individuals with pch1 also have very weak muscle tone (hypotonia), joint deformities called contractures, vision impairment, and breathing and feeding problems that are evident from early infancy. common features of pch2 include a lack of voluntary motor skills (such as grasping objects, sitting, or walking), problems with swallowing (dysphagia), and an absence of communication, including speech. affected children typically develop temporary jitteriness (generalized clonus) in early infancy, abnormal patterns of movement described as chorea or dystonia, and stiffness (spasticity). many also have impaired vision and seizures. the other forms of pontocerebellar hypoplasia, designated as type 3 (pch3) through type 10 (pch10), appear to be rare and have each been reported in only a small number of individuals. because the different types have overlapping features, and some are caused by mutations in the same genes, researchers have proposed that the types be considered as a spectrum instead of distinct conditions."

is familial isolated pituitary adenoma inherited ?,"fipa is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. however, only 20 to 30 percent of individuals with an aip gene mutation develop a pituitary adenoma. this phenomenon, in which some individuals with a mutation do not develop the features of a particular disorder, is called incomplete penetrance."
how many people are affected by bowen-conradi syndrome ?,bowen-conradi syndrome is common in the hutterite population in canada and the united states; it occurs in approximately 1 per 355 newborns in all three hutterite sects (leuts). a few individuals from outside the hutterite community with signs and symptoms similar to bowen-conradi syndrome have been described in the medical literature. researchers differ as to whether these individuals have bowen-conradi syndrome or a similar but distinct disorder.

how many people are affected by nakajo-nishimura syndrome ?,nakajo-nishimura syndrome appears to be rare and has been described only in the japanese population. about 30 cases have been reported in the medical literature.
is nakajo-nishimura syndrome inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what are the genetic changes related to congenital plasminogen deficiency ?,"congenital plasminogen deficiency is caused by mutations in the plg gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called plasminogen. enzymes called plasminogen activators convert plasminogen into the protein plasmin, which breaks down another protein called fibrin. fibrin is the main protein involved in blood clots and is important for wound healing, creating the framework for normal tissue to grow back. excess fibrin is broken down when no longer needed, and the new, more flexible normal tissue takes its place. plg gene mutations can decrease the amount of plasminogen that is produced, its function, or both. when the mutations affect plasminogen levels as well as the activity of the protein, affected individuals may be said to have type i congenital plasminogen deficiency, characterized by the ligneous growths previously described. people with mutations that result in normal levels of plasminogen with reduced activity are said to have type ii congenital plasminogen deficiency or dysplasminogenemia. this form of the condition often has no symptoms. a reduction in functional plasminogen results in less plasmin to break down fibrin, leading to a buildup of fibrin. the excess fibrin and the resulting inflammation of the tissue result in the inflamed woody growths characteristic of congenital plasminogen deficiency. it is unclear why the excess fibrin builds up in the mucous membranes but does not usually result in abnormal clots in the blood vessels (thromboses). researchers suggest that other enzymes in the blood may also break down fibrin, helping to compensate for the reduced plasminogen levels."
what are the genetic changes related to autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy ?,"mutations in the chrna2, chrna4, and chrnb2 genes can cause adnfle. these genes provide instructions for making different parts (subunits) of a larger molecule called a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nachr). this receptor plays an important role in chemical signaling between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. communication between neurons depends on chemicals called neurotransmitters, which are released from one neuron and taken up by neighboring neurons. researchers believe that mutations in the chrna2, chrna4, and chrnb2 genes affect the normal release and uptake of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. the resulting changes in signaling between neurons likely trigger the abnormal brain activity associated with seizures. the seizures associated with adnfle begin in areas of the brain called the frontal lobes. these regions of the brain are involved in many critical functions, including reasoning, planning, judgment, and problem-solving. it is unclear why mutations in the chrna2, chrna4, and chrnb2 genes cause seizures in the frontal lobes rather than elsewhere in the brain. researchers are also working to determine why these seizures occur most often during sleep. the genetic cause of adnfle has been identified in only a small percentage of affected families. in some cases, a gene other than those that make up the nachr are involved. in the remaining families, the cause of the condition is unknown. researchers are searching for other genetic changes, including mutations in other subunits of nachr, that may underlie the condition."
what is (are) multiple familial trichoepithelioma ?,"multiple familial trichoepithelioma is a condition involving multiple skin tumors that develop from structures associated with the skin (skin appendages), such as hair follicles and sweat glands. people with multiple familial trichoepithelioma typically develop large numbers of smooth, round tumors called trichoepitheliomas, which arise from hair follicles. trichoepitheliomas are generally noncancerous (benign) but occasionally develop into a type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma. individuals with multiple familial trichoepithelioma occasionally also develop other types of tumors, including growths called spiradenomas and cylindromas. spiradenomas develop in sweat glands. the origin of cylindromas has been unclear; while previously thought to derive from sweat glands, they are now generally believed to begin in hair follicles. affected individuals are also at increased risk of developing tumors in tissues other than skin appendages, particularly benign or malignant tumors of the salivary glands. people with multiple familial trichoepithelioma typically begin developing tumors during childhood or adolescence. the tumors mostly appear on the face, especially in the folds in the skin between the nose and lips (nasolabial folds, sometimes called smile lines), but may also occur on the neck, scalp, or trunk. they may grow larger and increase in number over time. in severe cases, the tumors may get in the way of the eyes, ears, nose, or mouth and affect vision, hearing, or other functions. the growths can be disfiguring and may contribute to depression or other psychological problems. for reasons that are unclear, females with multiple familial trichoepithelioma are often more severely affected than males."
"what are the genetic changes related to congenital deafness with labyrinthine aplasia, microtia, and microdontia ?","lamm syndrome is caused by mutations in the fgf3 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor 3 (fgf3). by attaching to another protein known as a receptor, the fgf3 protein triggers a cascade of chemical reactions inside the cell that signal the cell to undergo certain changes, such as dividing or maturing to take on specialized functions. during development before birth, the signals triggered by the fgf3 protein stimulate cells to form the structures that make up the inner ears. the fgf3 protein is also involved in the development of many other organs and structures, including the outer ears and teeth. fgf3 gene mutations involved in lamm syndrome alter the fgf3 protein. the altered protein likely has reduced or absent function and is unable to stimulate signaling. the loss of fgf3 function impairs development of the ears and teeth, which leads to the characteristic features of lamm syndrome."
what are the genetic changes related to foxg1 syndrome ?,"as its name suggests, foxg1 syndrome is caused by changes involving the foxg1 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called forkhead box g1. this protein plays an important role in brain development before birth, particularly in a region of the embryonic brain known as the telencephalon. the telencephalon ultimately develops into several critical structures, including the the largest part of the brain (the cerebrum), which controls most voluntary activity, language, sensory perception, learning, and memory. in some cases, foxg1 syndrome is caused by mutations within the foxg1 gene itself. in others, the condition results from a deletion of genetic material from a region of the long (q) arm of chromosome 14 that includes the foxg1 gene. all of these genetic changes prevent the production of forkhead box g1 or impair the protein's function. a shortage of functional forkhead box g1 disrupts normal brain development starting before birth, which appears to underlie the structural brain abnormalities and severe developmental problems characteristic of foxg1 syndrome."
is foxg1 syndrome inherited ?,"foxg1 syndrome is considered an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. all reported cases have resulted from new mutations or deletions involving the foxg1 gene and have occurred in people with no history of the disorder in their family. because the condition is so severe, no one with foxg1 syndrome has been known to have children."

what is (are) idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ?,"idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, progressive lung disease. this condition causes scar tissue (fibrosis) to build up in the lungs, which makes the lungs unable to transport oxygen into the bloodstream effectively. the disease usually affects people between the ages of 50 and 70. the most common signs and symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are shortness of breath and a persistent dry, hacking cough. many affected individuals also experience a loss of appetite and gradual weight loss. some people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis develop widened and rounded tips of the fingers and toes (clubbing) resulting from a shortage of oxygen. these features are relatively nonspecific; not everyone with these health problems has idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. other respiratory diseases, some of which are less serious, can cause similar signs and symptoms. in people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, scarring of the lungs increases over time until the lungs can no longer provide enough oxygen to the body's organs and tissues. some people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis develop other serious lung conditions, including lung cancer, blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary emboli), pneumonia, or high blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). most affected individuals survive 3 to 5 years after their diagnosis. however, the course of the disease is highly variable; some affected people become seriously ill within a few months, while others may live with the disease for a decade or longer. in most cases, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis occurs in only one person in a family. these cases are described as sporadic. however, a small percentage of people with this disease have at least one other affected family member. when idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis occurs in multiple members of the same family, it is known as familial pulmonary fibrosis."
how many people are affected by idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ?,"idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has an estimated prevalence of 13 to 20 per 100,000 people worldwide. about 100,000 people are affected in the united states, and 30,000 to 40,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. familial pulmonary fibrosis is less common than the sporadic form of the disease. only a small percentage of cases of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis appear to run in families."

how many people are affected by multiple endocrine neoplasia ?,"multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 affects about 1 in 30,000 people; multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 affects an estimated 1 in 35,000 people. among the subtypes of type 2, type 2a is the most common form, followed by fmtc. type 2b is relatively uncommon, accounting for about 5 percent of all cases of type 2. the prevalence of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4 is unknown, although the condition appears to be rare."
what are the genetic changes related to multiple endocrine neoplasia ?,"mutations in the men1, ret, and cdkn1b genes can cause multiple endocrine neoplasia. mutations in the men1 gene cause multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. this gene provides instructions for producing a protein called menin. menin acts as a tumor suppressor, which means it normally keeps cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. although the exact function of menin is unknown, it is likely involved in cell functions such as copying and repairing dna and regulating the activity of other genes. when mutations inactivate both copies of the men1 gene, menin is no longer available to control cell growth and division. the loss of functional menin allows cells to divide too frequently, leading to the formation of tumors characteristic of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. it is unclear why these tumors preferentially affect endocrine tissues. mutations in the ret gene cause multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. this gene provides instructions for producing a protein that is involved in signaling within cells. the ret protein triggers chemical reactions that instruct cells to respond to their environment, for example by dividing or maturing. mutations in the ret gene overactivate the protein's signaling function, which can trigger cell growth and division in the absence of signals from outside the cell. this unchecked cell division can lead to the formation of tumors in endocrine glands and other tissues. mutations in the cdkn1b gene cause multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called p27. like the menin protein, p27 is a tumor suppressor that helps control the growth and division of cells. mutations in the cdkn1b gene reduce the amount of functional p27, which allows cells to grow and divide unchecked. this unregulated cell division can lead to the development of tumors in endocrine glands and other tissues."
how many people are affected by kbg syndrome ?,"kbg syndrome is a rare disorder that has been reported in around 60 individuals. for unknown reasons, males are affected more often than females. doctors think the disorder is underdiagnosed because the signs and symptoms can be mild and may be attributed to other disorders."
is juvenile batten disease inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
how many people are affected by epidermolysis bullosa simplex ?,"the exact prevalence of epidermolysis bullosa simplex is unknown, but this condition is estimated to affect 1 in 30,000 to 50,000 people. the localized type is the most common form of the condition."
what are the genetic changes related to epidermolysis bullosa simplex ?,"the four major types of epidermolysis bullosa simplex can result from mutations in either the krt5 or krt14 gene. these genes provide instructions for making proteins called keratin 5 and keratin 14. these tough, fibrous proteins work together to provide strength and resiliency to the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis). mutations in either the krt5 or krt14 gene prevent the keratin proteins from assembling into strong networks, causing cells in the epidermis to become fragile and easily damaged. as a result, the skin is less resistant to friction and minor trauma and blisters easily. in rare cases, no krt5 or krt14 gene mutations are identified in people with one of the four major types of epidermolysis bullosa simplex. mutations in another gene, plec, have been associated with the rare ogna type of epidermolysis bullosa simplex. the plec gene provides instructions for making a protein called plectin, which helps attach the epidermis to underlying layers of skin. researchers are working to determine how plec gene mutations lead to the major features of the condition."
is epidermolysis bullosa simplex inherited ?,"epidermolysis bullosa simplex is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. some affected people inherit the mutation from one affected parent. other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. in rare cases, epidermolysis bullosa simplex is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. autosomal recessive inheritance means the condition results when two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder typically each carry one copy of the altered gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder."
how many people are affected by spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome ?,spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome is a rare disorder; its prevalence is unknown. at least 25 affected individuals have been identified.
what are the genetic changes related to axenfeld-rieger syndrome ?,"axenfeld-rieger syndrome results from mutations in at least two known genes, pitx2 and foxc1. pitx2 gene mutations cause type 1, and foxc1 gene mutations cause type 3. the gene associated with type 2 is likely located on chromosome 13, but it has not been identified. the proteins produced from the pitx2 and foxc1 genes are transcription factors, which means they attach (bind) to dna and help control the activity of other genes. these transcription factors are active before birth in the developing eye and in other parts of the body. they appear to play important roles in embryonic development, particularly in the formation of structures in the anterior segment of the eye. mutations in either the pitx2 or foxc1 gene disrupt the activity of other genes that are needed for normal development. impaired regulation of these genes leads to problems in the formation of the anterior segment of the eye and other parts of the body. these developmental abnormalities underlie the characteristic features of axenfeld-rieger syndrome. affected individuals with pitx2 gene mutations are more likely than those with foxc1 gene mutations to have abnormalities affecting parts of the body other than the eye. some people with axenfeld-rieger syndrome do not have identified mutations in the pitx2 or foxc1 genes. in these individuals, the cause of the condition is unknown. other as-yet-unidentified genes may also cause axenfeld-rieger syndrome."
what is (are) inclusion body myopathy with early-onset paget disease and frontotemporal dementia ?,"inclusion body myopathy with early-onset paget disease and frontotemporal dementia (ibmpfd) is a condition that can affect the muscles, bones, and brain. the first symptom of ibmpfd is often muscle weakness (myopathy), which typically appears in mid-adulthood. weakness first occurs in muscles of the hips and shoulders, making it difficult to climb stairs and raise the arms above the shoulders. as the disorder progresses, weakness develops in other muscles in the arms and legs. muscle weakness can also affect respiratory and heart (cardiac) muscles, leading to life-threatening breathing difficulties and heart failure. about half of all adults with ibmpfd develop a disorder called paget disease of bone. this disorder most often affects bones of the hips, spine, and skull, and the long bones of the arms and legs. bone pain, particularly in the hips and spine, is usually the major symptom of paget disease. rarely, this condition can weaken bones so much that they break (fracture). in about one-third of people with ibmpfd, the disorder also affects the brain. ibmpfd is associated with a brain condition called frontotemporal dementia, which becomes noticeable in a person's forties or fifties. frontotemporal dementia progressively damages parts of the brain that control reasoning, personality, social skills, speech, and language. people with this condition initially may have trouble speaking, remembering words and names (dysnomia), and using numbers (dyscalculia). personality changes, a loss of judgment, and inappropriate social behavior are also hallmarks of the disease. as the dementia worsens, affected people ultimately become unable to speak, read, or care for themselves. people with ibmpfd usually live into their fifties or sixties."

is nonsyndromic aplasia cutis congenita inherited ?,"most cases of nonsyndromic aplasia cutis congenita are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. when the condition runs in families, inheritance usually follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. rarely, the condition appears to follow an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means both copies of a gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
how many people are affected by dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans ?,"dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is estimated to occur in 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 1 million people per year."
what are the genetic changes related to dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans ?,"dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is associated with a rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 17 and 22. this translocation, written as t(17;22), fuses part of the col1a1 gene from chromosome 17 with part of the pdgfb gene from chromosome 22. the translocation is found on one or more extra chromosomes that can be either the normal linear shape or circular. when circular, the extra chromosomes are known as supernumerary ring chromosomes. ring chromosomes occur when a chromosome breaks in two places and the ends of the chromosome arms fuse together to form a circular structure. other genes from chromosomes 17 and 22 can be found on the extra chromosomes, but the role these genes play in development of the condition is unclear. the translocation is acquired during a person's lifetime and the chromosomes containing the translocation are present only in the tumor cells. this type of genetic change is called a somatic mutation. in normal cells, the col1a1 gene provides instructions for making part of a large molecule called type i collagen, which strengthens and supports many tissues in the body. the pdgfb gene provides instructions for making one version (isoform) of the platelet derived growth factor (pdgf) protein. by attaching to its receptor, the active pdgfb protein stimulates many cellular processes, including cell growth and division (proliferation) and maturation (differentiation). the abnormally fused col1a1-pdgfb gene provides instructions for making an abnormal combined (fusion) protein that researchers believe ultimately functions like the pdgfb protein. the gene fusion leads to the production of an excessive amount of protein that functions like the pdgfb protein. in excess, this fusion protein stimulates cells to proliferate and differentiate abnormally, leading to the tumor formation seen in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. the col1a1-pdgfb fusion gene is found in more than 90 percent of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans cases. in the remaining cases, changes in other genes may be associated with this condition. these genes have not been identified."
what is (are) pitt-hopkins syndrome ?,"pitt-hopkins syndrome is a condition characterized by intellectual disability and developmental delay, breathing problems, recurrent seizures (epilepsy), and distinctive facial features. people with pitt-hopkins syndrome have moderate to severe intellectual disability. most affected individuals have delayed development of mental and motor skills (psychomotor delay). they are delayed in learning to walk and developing fine motor skills such as picking up small items with their fingers. people with pitt-hopkins syndrome typically do not develop speech; some may learn to say a few words. many affected individuals exhibit features of autistic spectrum disorders, which are characterized by impaired communication and socialization skills. breathing problems in individuals with pitt-hopkins syndrome are characterized by episodes of rapid breathing (hyperventilation) followed by periods in which breathing slows or stops (apnea). these episodes can cause a lack of oxygen in the blood, leading to a bluish appearance of the skin or lips (cyanosis). in some cases, the lack of oxygen can cause loss of consciousness. some older individuals with pitt-hopkins syndrome develop widened and rounded tips of the fingers and toes (clubbing) because of recurrent episodes of decreased oxygen in the blood. the breathing problems occur only when the person is awake and typically first appear in mid-childhood, but they can begin as early as infancy. episodes of hyperventilation and apnea can be triggered by emotions such as excitement or anxiety or by extreme tiredness (fatigue). epilepsy occurs in most people with pitt-hopkins syndrome and usually begins during childhood, although it can be present from birth. individuals with pitt-hopkins syndrome have distinctive facial features that include thin eyebrows, sunken eyes, a prominent nose with a high nasal bridge, a pronounced double curve of the upper lip (cupid's bow), a wide mouth with full lips, and widely spaced teeth. the ears are usually thick and cup-shaped. children with pitt-hopkins syndrome typically have a happy, excitable demeanor with frequent smiling, laughter, and hand-flapping movements. however, they can also experience anxiety and behavioral problems. other features of pitt-hopkins syndrome may include constipation and other gastrointestinal problems, an unusually small head (microcephaly), nearsightedness (myopia), eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus), short stature, and minor brain abnormalities. affected individuals may also have small hands and feet, a single crease across the palms of the hands, flat feet (pes planus), or unusually fleshy pads at the tips of the fingers and toes. males with pitt-hopkins syndrome may have undescended testes (cryptorchidism)."

what is (are) glycogen storage disease type 0 ?,"glycogen storage disease type 0 (also known as gsd 0) is a condition caused by the body's inability to form a complex sugar called glycogen, which is a major source of stored energy in the body. gsd 0 has two types: in muscle gsd 0, glycogen formation in the muscles is impaired, and in liver gsd 0, glycogen formation in the liver is impaired. the signs and symptoms of muscle gsd 0 typically begin in early childhood. affected individuals often experience muscle pain and weakness or episodes of fainting (syncope) following moderate physical activity, such as walking up stairs. the loss of consciousness that occurs with fainting typically lasts up to several hours. some individuals with muscle gsd 0 have a disruption of the heart's normal rhythm (arrhythmia) known as long qt syndrome. in all affected individuals, muscle gsd 0 impairs the heart's ability to effectively pump blood and increases the risk of cardiac arrest and sudden death, particularly after physical activity. sudden death from cardiac arrest can occur in childhood or adolescence in people with muscle gsd 0. individuals with liver gsd 0 usually show signs and symptoms of the disorder in infancy. people with this disorder develop low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) after going long periods of time without food (fasting). signs of hypoglycemia become apparent when affected infants begin sleeping through the night and stop late-night feedings; these infants exhibit extreme tiredness (lethargy), pale skin (pallor), and nausea. during episodes of fasting, ketone levels in the blood may increase (ketosis). ketones are molecules produced during the breakdown of fats, which occurs when stored sugars (such as glycogen) are unavailable. these short-term signs and symptoms of liver gsd 0 often improve when food is eaten and sugar levels in the body return to normal. the features of liver gsd 0 vary; they can be mild and go unnoticed for years, or they can include developmental delay and growth failure."

what is (are) juvenile idiopathic arthritis ?,"juvenile idiopathic arthritis refers to a group of conditions involving joint inflammation (arthritis) that first appears before the age of 16. this condition is an autoimmune disorder, which means that the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's organs and tissues, in this case the joints. researchers have described seven types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. the types are distinguished by their signs and symptoms, the number of joints affected, the results of laboratory tests, and the family history. systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis causes inflammation in one or more joints. a high daily fever that lasts at least 2 weeks either precedes or accompanies the arthritis. individuals with systemic arthritis may also have a skin rash or enlargement of the lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), liver (hepatomegaly), or spleen (splenomegaly). oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (also known as oligoarthritis) has no features other than joint inflammation. oligoarthritis is marked by the occurrence of arthritis in four or fewer joints in the first 6 months of the disease. it is divided into two subtypes depending on the course of disease. if the arthritis is confined to four or fewer joints after 6 months, then the condition is classified as persistent oligoarthritis. if more than four joints are affected after 6 months, this condition is classified as extended oligoarthritis. rheumatoid factor positive polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (also known as polyarthritis, rheumatoid factor positive) causes inflammation in five or more joints within the first 6 months of the disease. individuals with this condition also have a positive blood test for proteins called rheumatoid factors. this type of arthritis closely resembles rheumatoid arthritis as seen in adults. rheumatoid factor negative polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (also known as polyarthritis, rheumatoid factor negative) is also characterized by arthritis in five or more joints within the first 6 months of the disease. individuals with this type, however, test negative for rheumatoid factor in the blood. psoriatic juvenile idiopathic arthritis involves arthritis that usually occurs in combination with a skin disorder called psoriasis. psoriasis is a condition characterized by patches of red, irritated skin that are often covered by flaky white scales. some affected individuals develop psoriasis before arthritis while others first develop arthritis. other features of psoriatic arthritis include abnormalities of the fingers and nails or eye problems. enthesitis-related juvenile idiopathic arthritis is characterized by tenderness where the bone meets a tendon, ligament or other connective tissue. this tenderness, known as enthesitis, accompanies the joint inflammation of arthritis. enthesitis-related arthritis may also involve inflammation in parts of the body other than the joints. the last type of juvenile idiopathic arthritis is called undifferentiated arthritis. this classification is given to affected individuals who do not fit into any of the above types or who fulfill the criteria for more than one type of juvenile idiopathic arthritis."
is juvenile idiopathic arthritis inherited ?,"most cases of juvenile idiopathic arthritis are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. a small percentage of cases of juvenile idiopathic arthritis have been reported to run in families, although the inheritance pattern of the condition is unclear. a sibling of a person with juvenile idiopathic arthritis has an estimated risk of developing the condition that is about 12 times that of the general population."

what are the genetic changes related to hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis ?,"mutations in the fgf23, galnt3, or kl gene cause hftc. the proteins produced from these genes are all involved in the regulation of phosphate levels within the body (phosphate homeostasis). among its many functions, phosphate plays a critical role in the formation and growth of bones in childhood and helps maintain bone strength in adults. phosphate levels are controlled in large part by the kidneys. the kidneys normally rid the body of excess phosphate by excreting it in urine, and they reabsorb this mineral into the bloodstream when more is needed. the fgf23 gene provides instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor 23, which is produced in bone cells and signals the kidneys to stop reabsorbing phosphate. the proteins produced from the galnt3 and kl genes help to regulate fibroblast growth factor 23. the protein produced from the galnt3 gene, called ppgalnact3, attaches sugar molecules to fibroblast growth factor 23 in a process called glycosylation. glycosylation allows fibroblast growth factor 23 to move out of the cell and protects the protein from being broken down. once outside the bone cell, fibroblast growth factor 23 must attach (bind) to a receptor protein that spans the membrane of kidney cells. the protein produced from the kl gene, called alpha-klotho, turns on (activates) the receptor protein so that fibroblast growth factor 23 can bind to it. binding of fibroblast growth factor 23 to its receptor stimulates signaling that stops phosphate reabsorption into the bloodstream. mutations in the fgf23, galnt3, or kl gene lead to a disruption in fibroblast growth factor 23 signaling. fgf23 gene mutations result in the production of a protein with decreased function that quickly gets broken down. mutations in the galnt3 gene result in the production of ppgalnact3 protein with little or no function. as a result, the protein cannot glycosylate fibroblast growth factor 23, which is consequently trapped inside the cell and broken down rather than being released from the cell (secreted). kl gene mutations lead to a shortage of functional alpha-klotho. as a result, the receptor protein is not activated, causing it to be unavailable to be bound to fibroblast growth factor 23. all of these impairments to fibroblast growth factor 23 function and signaling lead to increased phosphate absorption by the kidneys. calcinosis results when the excess phosphate combines with calcium to form deposits that build up in soft tissues. although phosphate levels are increased, calcium is typically within the normal range."

what is (are) caffey disease ?,"caffey disease, also called infantile cortical hyperostosis, is a bone disorder that most often occurs in babies. excessive new bone formation (hyperostosis) is characteristic of caffey disease. the bone abnormalities mainly affect the jawbone, shoulder blades (scapulae), collarbones (clavicles), and the shafts (diaphyses) of long bones in the arms and legs. affected bones may double or triple in width, which can be seen by x-ray imaging. in some cases two bones that are next to each other, such as two ribs or the pairs of long bones in the forearms (radius and ulna) or lower legs (tibia and fibula) become fused together. babies with caffey disease also have swelling of joints and of soft tissues such as muscles, with pain and redness in the affected areas. affected infants can also be feverish and irritable. the signs and symptoms of caffey disease are usually apparent by the time an infant is 5 months old. in rare cases, skeletal abnormalities can be detected by ultrasound imaging during the last few weeks of development before birth. lethal prenatal cortical hyperostosis, a more severe disorder that appears earlier in development and is often fatal before or shortly after birth, is sometimes called lethal prenatal caffey disease; however, it is generally considered to be a separate disorder. for unknown reasons, the swelling and pain associated with caffey disease typically go away within a few months. through a normal process called bone remodeling, which replaces old bone tissue with new bone, the excess bone is usually reabsorbed by the body and undetectable on x-ray images by the age of 2. however, if two adjacent bones have fused, they may remain that way, possibly resulting in complications. for example, fused rib bones can lead to curvature of the spine (scoliosis) or limit expansion of the chest, resulting in breathing problems. most people with caffey disease have no further problems related to the disorder after early childhood. occasionally, another episode of hyperostosis occurs years later. in addition, some adults who had caffey disease in infancy have other abnormalities of the bones and connective tissues, which provide strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body. affected adults may have loose joints (joint laxity), stretchy (hyperextensible) skin, or be prone to protrusion of organs through gaps in muscles (hernias)."

what is (are) acatalasemia ?,"acatalasemia is a condition characterized by very low levels of an enzyme called catalase. many people with acatalasemia never have any health problems related to the condition and are diagnosed because they have affected family members. some of the first reported individuals with acatalasemia developed open sores (ulcers) inside the mouth that led to the death of soft tissue (gangrene). when mouth ulcers and gangrene occur with acatalasemia, the condition is known as takahara disease. these complications are rarely seen in more recent cases of acatalasemia, probably because of improvements in oral hygiene. studies suggest that people with acatalasemia have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is the most common form of diabetes. a higher percentage of people with acatalasemia have type 2 diabetes mellitus than in the general population, and the disease tends to develop at an earlier age (in a person's thirties or forties, on average). researchers speculate that acatalasemia could also be a risk factor for other common, complex diseases; however, only a small number of cases have been studied."
what is (are) ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate syndrome ?,"ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate (aec) syndrome is a form of ectodermal dysplasia, a group of about 150 conditions characterized by abnormal development of ectodermal tissues including the skin, hair, nails, teeth, and sweat glands. among the most common features of aec syndrome are missing patches of skin (erosions). in affected infants, skin erosions most commonly occur on the scalp. they tend to recur throughout childhood and into adulthood, frequently affecting the scalp, neck, hands, and feet. the skin erosions range from mild to severe and can lead to infection, scarring, and hair loss. other ectodermal abnormalities in aec syndrome include changes in skin coloring; brittle, sparse, or missing hair; misshapen or absent fingernails and toenails; and malformed or missing teeth. affected individuals also report increased sensitivity to heat and a reduced ability to sweat. many infants with aec syndrome are born with an eyelid condition known as ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum, in which strands of tissue partially or completely fuse the upper and lower eyelids. most people with aec syndrome are also born with an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), a split in the lip (a cleft lip), or both. cleft lip or cleft palate can make it difficult for affected infants to suck, so these infants often have trouble feeding and do not grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). additional features of aec syndrome can include limb abnormalities, most commonly fused fingers and toes (syndactyly). less often, affected individuals have permanently bent fingers and toes (camptodactyly) or a deep split in the hands or feet with missing fingers or toes and fusion of the remaining digits (ectrodactyly). hearing loss is common, occurring in more than 90 percent of children with aec syndrome. some affected individuals have distinctive facial features, such as small jaws that cannot open fully and a narrow space between the upper lip and nose (philtrum). other signs and symptoms can include the opening of the urethra on the underside of the penis (hypospadias) in affected males, digestive problems, absent tear duct openings in the eyes, and chronic sinus or ear infections. a condition known as rapp-hodgkin syndrome has signs and symptoms that overlap considerably with those of aec syndrome. these two syndromes were classified as separate disorders until it was discovered that they both result from mutations in the same part of the same gene. most researchers now consider rapp-hodgkin syndrome and aec syndrome to be part of the same disease spectrum."

what are the genetic changes related to pallister-hall syndrome ?,"mutations in the gli3 gene cause pallister-hall syndrome. the gli3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that controls gene expression, which is a process that regulates whether genes are turned on or off in particular cells. by interacting with certain genes at specific times during development, the gli3 protein plays a role in the normal shaping (patterning) of many organs and tissues before birth. mutations that cause pallister-hall syndrome typically lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the gli3 protein. unlike the normal gli3 protein, which can turn target genes on or off, the short protein can only turn off (repress) target genes. researchers are working to determine how this change in the protein's function affects early development. it remains uncertain how gli3 mutations can cause polydactyly, hypothalamic hamartoma, and the other features of pallister-hall syndrome."
what is (are) persistent mllerian duct syndrome ?,"persistent mllerian duct syndrome is a disorder of sexual development that affects males. males with this disorder have normal male reproductive organs, though they also have a uterus and fallopian tubes, which are female reproductive organs. the uterus and fallopian tubes are derived from a structure called the mllerian duct during development of the fetus. the mllerian duct usually breaks down during early development in males, but it is retained in those with persistent mllerian duct syndrome. affected individuals have the normal chromosomes of a male (46,xy) and normal external male genitalia. the first noted signs and symptoms in males with persistent mllerian duct syndrome are usually undescended testes (cryptorchidism) or soft out-pouchings in the lower abdomen (inguinal hernias). the uterus and fallopian tubes are typically discovered when surgery is performed to treat these conditions. the testes and female reproductive organs can be located in unusual positions in persistent mllerian duct syndrome. occasionally, both testes are undescended (bilateral cryptorchidism) and the uterus is in the pelvis. more often, one testis has descended into the scrotum normally, and one has not. sometimes, the descended testis pulls the fallopian tube and uterus into the track through which it has descended. this creates a condition called hernia uteri inguinalis, a form of inguinal hernia. in other cases, the undescended testis from the other side of the body is also pulled into the same track, forming an inguinal hernia. this condition, called transverse testicular ectopia, is common in people with persistent mllerian duct syndrome. other effects of persistent mllerian duct syndrome may include the inability to father children (infertility) or blood in the semen (hematospermia). also, the undescended testes may break down (degenerate) or develop cancer if left untreated."
how many people are affected by persistent mllerian duct syndrome ?,"persistent mllerian duct syndrome is a rare disorder; however, the prevalence of the condition is unknown."
what are the genetic changes related to persistent mllerian duct syndrome ?,"most people with persistent mllerian duct syndrome have mutations in the amh gene or the amhr2 gene. the amh gene provides instructions for making a protein called anti-mllerian hormone (amh). the amhr2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called amh receptor type 2. the amh protein and amh receptor type 2 protein are involved in male sex differentiation. all fetuses develop the mllerian duct, the precursor to female reproductive organs. during development of a male fetus, these two proteins work together to induce breakdown (regression) of the mllerian duct. mutations in the amh and amhr2 genes lead to nonfunctional proteins that cannot signal for regression of the mllerian duct. as a result of these mutations, the mllerian duct persists and goes on to form a uterus and fallopian tubes. approximately 45 percent of cases of persistent mllerian duct syndrome are caused by mutations in the amh gene and are called persistent mllerian duct syndrome type 1. approximately 40 percent of cases are caused by mutations in the amhr2 gene and are called persistent mllerian duct syndrome type 2. in the remaining 15 percent of cases, no mutations in the amh and amhr2 genes have been identified, and the genes involved in causing the condition are unknown."
what are the genetic changes related to donohue syndrome ?,"donohue syndrome results from mutations in the insr gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called an insulin receptor, which is found in many types of cells. insulin receptors are embedded in the outer membrane surrounding the cell, where they attach (bind) to insulin circulating in the bloodstream. this binding triggers signaling pathways that influence many cell functions. the insr gene mutations that cause donohue syndrome greatly reduce the number of insulin receptors that reach the cell membrane or disrupt the function of these receptors. although insulin is present in the bloodstream, without functional receptors it cannot exert its effects on cells and tissues. this severe resistance to the effects of insulin impairs blood sugar regulation and affects many aspects of development in people with donohue syndrome."
what is (are) atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome ?,"atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is a disease that primarily affects kidney function. this condition, which can occur at any age, causes abnormal blood clots (thrombi) to form in small blood vessels in the kidneys. these clots can cause serious medical problems if they restrict or block blood flow. atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is characterized by three major features related to abnormal clotting: hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and kidney failure. hemolytic anemia occurs when red blood cells break down (undergo hemolysis) prematurely. in atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, red blood cells can break apart as they squeeze past clots within small blood vessels. anemia results if these cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. this condition can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate. thrombocytopenia is a reduced level of circulating platelets, which are cell fragments that normally assist with blood clotting. in people with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, fewer platelets are available in the bloodstream because a large number of platelets are used to make abnormal clots. thrombocytopenia can cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding. as a result of clot formation in small blood vessels, people with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome experience kidney damage and acute kidney failure that lead to end-stage renal disease (esrd) in about half of all cases. these life-threatening complications prevent the kidneys from filtering fluids and waste products from the body effectively. atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome should be distinguished from a more common condition called typical hemolytic-uremic syndrome. the two disorders have different causes and different signs and symptoms. unlike the atypical form, the typical form is caused by infection with certain strains of escherichia coli bacteria that produce toxic substances called shiga-like toxins. the typical form is characterized by severe diarrhea and most often affects children younger than 10. the typical form is less likely than the atypical form to involve recurrent attacks of kidney damage that lead to esrd."

what is (are) laryngo-onycho-cutaneous syndrome ?,"laryngo-onycho-cutaneous (loc) syndrome is a disorder that leads to abnormalities of the voicebox (laryngo-), finger- and toenails (onycho-), and skin (cutaneous). many of the condition's signs and symptoms are related to the abnormal growth of granulation tissue in different parts of the body. this red, bumpy tissue is normally produced during wound healing and is usually replaced by skin cells as healing continues. however, in people with loc syndrome, this tissue grows even when there is no major injury. one of the first symptoms in infants with loc syndrome is a hoarse cry due to ulcers or overgrowth of granulation tissue in the voicebox (the larynx). excess granulation tissue can also block the airways, leading to life-threatening breathing problems; as a result many affected individuals do not survive past childhood. in loc syndrome, granulation tissue also grows in the eyes, specifically the conjunctiva, which are the moist tissues that line the eyelids and the white part of the eyes. affected individuals often have impairment or complete loss of vision due to the tissue overgrowth. another common feature of loc syndrome is missing patches of skin (cutaneous erosions). the erosions heal slowly and may become infected. people with loc syndrome can also have malformed nails and small, abnormal teeth. the hard, white material that forms the protective outer layer of each tooth (enamel) is thin, which contributes to frequent cavities. loc syndrome is typically considered a subtype of another skin condition called junctional epidermolysis bullosa, which is characterized by fragile skin that blisters easily. while individuals with junctional epidermolysis bullosa can have some of the features of loc syndrome, they do not usually have overgrowth of granulation tissue in the conjunctiva."
what are the genetic changes related to laryngo-onycho-cutaneous syndrome ?,"loc syndrome is caused by mutations in the lama3 gene, which provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of a protein called laminin 332. this protein is made up of three subunits, called alpha, beta, and gamma. the lama3 gene carries instructions for the alpha subunit; the beta and gamma subunits are produced from other genes. the laminin 332 protein plays an important role in strengthening and stabilizing the skin by helping to attach the top layer of skin (the epidermis) to underlying layers. studies suggest that laminin 332 is also involved in wound healing. additionally, researchers have proposed roles for laminin 332 in the clear outer covering of the eye (the cornea) and in the development of tooth enamel. the mutations involved in loc syndrome alter the structure of one version of the alpha subunit of laminin 332 (called alpha-3a). laminins made with the altered subunit cannot effectively attach the epidermis to underlying layers of skin or regulate wound healing. these abnormalities of laminin 332 cause the cutaneous erosions and overgrowth of granulation tissue that are characteristic of loc syndrome. the inability of laminin 332 to perform its other functions leads to the nail and tooth abnormalities that occur in this condition."
what are the genetic changes related to dentinogenesis imperfecta ?,"mutations in the dspp gene have been identified in people with dentinogenesis imperfecta type ii and type iii. mutations in this gene are also responsible for dentin dysplasia type ii. dentinogenesis imperfecta type i occurs as part of osteogenesis imperfecta, which is caused by mutations in one of several other genes (most often the col1a1 or col1a2 genes). the dspp gene provides instructions for making two proteins that are essential for normal tooth development. these proteins are involved in the formation of dentin, which is a bone-like substance that makes up the protective middle layer of each tooth. dspp gene mutations alter the proteins made from the gene, leading to the production of abnormally soft dentin. teeth with defective dentin are discolored, weak, and more likely to decay and break. it is unclear whether dspp gene mutations are related to the hearing loss found in a few older individuals with dentinogenesis imperfecta type ii."
is congenital dyserythropoietic anemia inherited ?,"the inheritance pattern of cda depends on the type of the disorder. cda types i and ii are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the associated gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. in several families, cda type iii appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in these families, affected individuals often have a parent and other relatives with the condition."
"what is (are) multicentric osteolysis, nodulosis, and arthropathy ?","multicentric osteolysis, nodulosis, and arthropathy (mona) describes a rare inherited disease characterized by a loss of bone tissue (osteolysis), particularly in the hands and feet. mona includes a condition formerly called nodulosis-arthropathy-osteolysis (nao) syndrome. it may also include a similar disorder called torg syndrome, although it is unknown whether torg syndrome is actually part of mona or a separate disorder caused by a mutation in a different gene. in most cases of mona, bone loss begins in the hands and feet, causing pain and limiting movement. bone abnormalities can later spread to other areas of the body, with joint problems (arthropathy) occurring in the elbows, shoulders, knees, hips, and spine. most people with mona develop low bone mineral density (osteopenia) and thinning of the bones (osteoporosis) throughout the skeleton. these abnormalities make bones brittle and more prone to fracture. the bone abnormalities also lead to short stature. many affected individuals develop subcutaneous nodules, which are firm lumps of noncancerous tissue underneath the skin, especially on the soles of the feet. some affected individuals also have skin abnormalities including patches of dark, thick, and leathery skin. other features of mona can include clouding of the clear front covering of the eye (corneal opacity), excess hair growth (hypertrichosis), overgrowth of the gums, heart abnormalities, and distinctive facial features that are described as ""coarse."""

how many people are affected by eosinophil peroxidase deficiency ?,"approximately 100 individuals with eosinophil peroxidase deficiency have been described in the scientific literature. based on blood test data, varying estimates of the prevalence of the condition have been reported in specific populations. eosinophil peroxidase deficiency is estimated to occur in 8.6 in 1,000 yemenite jews, in 3 in 1,000 north-african jews, and in 1 in 1,000 iraqi jews. in northeastern italy, the condition occurs in approximately 1 in 14,000 individuals; in japan it occurs in 1 in 36,000 people; and in luxembourg, eosinophil peroxidase deficiency is thought to occur in 1 in 100,000 people."
what are the genetic changes related to mannose-binding lectin deficiency ?,"relatively common mutations in the mbl2 gene can lead to mannose-binding lectin deficiency. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that assembles into a complex called mannose-binding lectin. functional mannose-binding lectins are made up of two to six protein groups called trimers, which are each composed of three of the protein pieces (subunits) produced from the mbl2 gene. mannose-binding lectin plays an important role in the body's immune response by attaching to foreign invaders such as bacteria, viruses, or yeast and turning on (activating) the complement system. the complement system is a group of immune system proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders (pathogens), trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. mannose-binding lectin can also stimulate special immune cells to engulf and break down the attached pathogen. disease-associated mutations in the mbl2 gene can reduce the production of the mannose-binding lectin subunit or eliminate the subunit's ability to assemble into functional mannose-binding lectin. a decrease in the availability of the normal subunit protein may lead to a reduction of the functional mannose-binding lectin in blood. with decreased levels of mannose-binding lectin, the body does not recognize and fight foreign invaders efficiently. consequently, infections can be more common in people with this condition. however, not everyone with a change in the mbl2 gene has decreased levels of mannose-binding lectin, and not everyone with decreased protein levels is prone to infection. researchers believe that a number of factors, including other genetic and environmental factors, are involved in the development of mannose-binding lectin deficiency and susceptibility to infection."

is x-linked sideroblastic anemia inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. the gene associated with this condition is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by x-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons. in x-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one altered copy of the gene in each cell is called a carrier. carriers of an alas2 mutation can pass on the mutated gene, but most do not develop any symptoms associated with x-linked sideroblastic anemia. however, carriers may have abnormally small, pale red blood cells and related changes that can be detected with a blood test."
how many people are affected by keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome ?,kid syndrome is a rare disorder. its prevalence is unknown. approximately 100 cases have been reported.
is centronuclear myopathy inherited ?,"when centronuclear myopathy is caused by mutations in the dnm2 gene, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered dnm2 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. rarely, bin1 gene mutations that are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern can cause centronuclear myopathy. centronuclear myopathy caused by ttn gene mutations and most cases caused by bin1 gene mutations are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. other cases of centronuclear myopathy that are not caused by these genes are typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, although some follow an autosomal dominant pattern."
what are the genetic changes related to glutaric acidemia type ii ?,"mutations in any of three genes, etfa, etfb, and etfdh, can result in glutaric acidemia type ii. the etfa and etfb genes provide instructions for producing two protein segments, or subunits, that come together to make an enzyme called electron transfer flavoprotein. the etfdh gene provides instructions for making another enzyme called electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase. glutaric acidemia type ii is caused by a deficiency in either of these two enzymes. electron transfer flavoprotein and electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase are normally active in the mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers of cells. these enzymes help break down proteins and fats to provide energy for the body. when one of the enzymes is defective or missing, partially broken down nutrients accumulate in the cells and damage them, causing the signs and symptoms of glutaric acidemia type ii. people with mutations that result in a complete loss of either enzyme produced from the etfa, etfb or etfdh genes are likely to experience the most severe symptoms of glutaric acidemia type ii. mutations that allow the enzyme to retain some activity may result in milder forms of the disorder."
what are the genetic changes related to 15q24 microdeletion ?,"people with a 15q24 microdeletion are missing between 1.7 million and 6.1 million dna building blocks (base pairs), also written as 1.7-6.1 megabases (mb), at position q24 on chromosome 15. the exact size of the deletion varies, but all individuals are missing the same 1.2 mb region. this region contains several genes that are thought to be important for normal development. the signs and symptoms that result from a 15q24 microdeletion are probably related to the loss of one or more genes in the deleted region. however, it is unclear which missing genes contribute to the specific features of the disorder."
is 15q24 microdeletion inherited ?,the identified cases of 15q24 microdeletion have occurred in people with no history of the condition in their family. the chromosomal change likely occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early fetal development.

how many people are affected by van der woude syndrome ?,"van der woude syndrome is believed to occur in 1 in 35,000 to 1 in 100,000 people, based on data from europe and asia. van der woude syndrome is the most common cause of cleft lip and palate resulting from variations in a single gene, and this condition accounts for approximately 1 in 50 such cases."
how many people are affected by farber lipogranulomatosis ?,farber lipogranulomatosis is a rare disorder. about 80 cases have been reported worldwide.
is smith-magenis syndrome inherited ?,"smith-magenis syndrome is typically not inherited. this condition usually results from a genetic change that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early fetal development. most often, people with smith-magenis syndrome have no history of the condition in their family."
what is (are) vitelliform macular dystrophy ?,"vitelliform macular dystrophy is a genetic eye disorder that can cause progressive vision loss. this disorder affects the retina, the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. specifically, vitelliform macular dystrophy disrupts cells in a small area near the center of the retina called the macula. the macula is responsible for sharp central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. vitelliform macular dystrophy causes a fatty yellow pigment (lipofuscin) to build up in cells underlying the macula. over time, the abnormal accumulation of this substance can damage cells that are critical for clear central vision. as a result, people with this disorder often lose their central vision, and their eyesight may become blurry or distorted. vitelliform macular dystrophy typically does not affect side (peripheral) vision or the ability to see at night. researchers have described two forms of vitelliform macular dystrophy with similar features. the early-onset form (known as best disease) usually appears in childhood; the onset of symptoms and the severity of vision loss vary widely. the adult-onset form begins later, usually in mid-adulthood, and tends to cause vision loss that worsens slowly over time. the two forms of vitelliform macular dystrophy each have characteristic changes in the macula that can be detected during an eye examination."
how many people are affected by uv-sensitive syndrome ?,"uv-sensitive syndrome appears to be a rare condition; only a small number of affected individuals have been reported in the scientific literature. however, this condition may be underdiagnosed."
what is (are) zellweger spectrum disorder ?,"zellweger spectrum disorder is a group of conditions that have overlapping signs and symptoms and affect many parts of the body. this group of conditions includes zellweger syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (nald), and infantile refsum disease. these conditions were once thought to be distinct disorders but are now considered to be part of the same condition spectrum. zellweger syndrome is the most severe form of the zellweger spectrum disorder, nald is intermediate in severity, and infantile refsum disease is the least severe form. because these three conditions are now considered one disorder, some researchers prefer not to use the separate condition names but to instead refer to cases as severe, intermediate, or mild. individuals with zellweger syndrome, at the severe end of the spectrum, develop signs and symptoms of the condition during the newborn period. these infants experience weak muscle tone (hypotonia), feeding problems, hearing and vision loss, and seizures. these problems are caused by the breakdown of myelin, which is the covering that protects nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. the part of the brain and spinal cord that contains myelin is called white matter. destruction of myelin (demyelination) leads to loss of white matter (leukodystrophy). children with zellweger syndrome also develop life-threatening problems in other organs and tissues, such as the liver, heart, and kidneys. they may have skeletal abnormalities, including a large space between the bones of the skull (fontanels) and characteristic bone spots known as chondrodysplasia punctata that can be seen on x-ray. affected individuals have distinctive facial features, including a flattened face, broad nasal bridge, and high forehead. children with zellweger syndrome typically do not survive beyond the first year of life. people with nald or infantile refsum disease, which are at the less-severe end of the spectrum, have more variable features than those with zellweger syndrome and usually do not develop signs and symptoms of the disease until late infancy or early childhood. they may have many of the features of zellweger syndrome; however, their condition typically progresses more slowly. children with these less-severe conditions often have hypotonia, vision problems, hearing loss, liver dysfunction, developmental delay, and some degree of intellectual disability. most people with nald survive into childhood, and those with infantile refsum disease may reach adulthood. in rare cases, individuals at the mildest end of the condition spectrum have developmental delay in childhood and hearing loss or vision problems beginning in adulthood and do not develop the other features of this disorder."
what is (are) hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type ie ?,"hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type ie (hsan ie) is a disorder that affects the nervous system. affected individuals have a gradual loss of intellectual function (dementia), typically beginning in their thirties. in some people with this disorder, changes in personality become apparent before problems with thinking skills. people with hsan ie also develop hearing loss that is caused by abnormalities in the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss). the hearing loss gets worse over time and usually progresses to moderate or severe deafness between the ages of 20 and 35. hsan ie is characterized by impaired function of nerve cells called sensory neurons, which transmit information about sensations such as pain, temperature, and touch. sensations in the feet and legs are particularly affected in people with hsan ie. gradual loss of sensation in the feet (peripheral neuropathy), which usually begins in adolescence or early adulthood, can lead to difficulty walking. affected individuals may not be aware of injuries to their feet, which can lead to open sores and infections. if these complications are severe, amputation of the affected areas may be required. hsan ie is also characterized by a loss of the ability to sweat (sudomotor function), especially on the hands and feet. sweating is a function of the autonomic nervous system, which also controls involuntary body functions such as heart rate, digestion, and breathing. these other autonomic functions are unaffected in people with hsan ie. the severity of the signs and symptoms of hsan ie and their age of onset are variable, even within the same family."
how many people are affected by multiple pterygium syndrome ?,the prevalence of multiple pterygium syndrome is unknown.
how many people are affected by aarskog-scott syndrome ?,"aarskog-scott syndrome is believed to be a rare disorder; however, its prevalence is unknown because mildly affected people are often not diagnosed."
is x-linked thrombocytopenia inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an x-linked pattern. the gene associated with this condition is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell may or may not cause the disorder. in males (who have only one x chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder. in most cases of x-linked inheritance, males experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons."
what is (are) ophthalmo-acromelic syndrome ?,"ophthalmo-acromelic syndrome is a condition that results in malformations of the eyes, hands, and feet. the features of this condition are present from birth. the eyes are often absent or severely underdeveloped (anophthalmia), or they may be abnormally small (microphthalmia). usually both eyes are similarly affected in this condition, but if only one eye is small or missing, the other eye may have a defect such as a gap or split in its structures (coloboma). the most common hand and foot malformation seen in ophthalmo-acromelic syndrome is missing fingers or toes (oligodactyly). other frequent malformations include fingers or toes that are fused together (syndactyly) or extra fingers or toes (polydactyly). these skeletal malformations are often described as acromelic, meaning that they occur in the bones that are away from the center of the body. additional skeletal abnormalities involving the long bones of the arms and legs or the spinal bones (vertebrae) can also occur. affected individuals may have distinctive facial features, an opening in the lip (cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate), or intellectual disability."
how many people are affected by ophthalmo-acromelic syndrome ?,the prevalence of ophthalmo-acromelic syndrome is not known; approximately 35 cases have been reported in the medical literature.
what is (are) maffucci syndrome ?,"maffucci syndrome is a disorder that primarily affects the bones and skin. it is characterized by multiple enchondromas, which are noncancerous (benign) growths of cartilage that develop within the bones. these growths most commonly occur in the limb bones, especially in the bones of the hands and feet; however, they may also occur in the skull, ribs, and bones of the spine (vertebrae). enchondromas may result in severe bone deformities, shortening of the limbs, and fractures. the signs and symptoms of maffucci syndrome may be detectable at birth, although they generally do not become apparent until around the age of 5. enchondromas develop near the ends of bones, where normal growth occurs, and they frequently stop forming after affected individuals stop growing in early adulthood. as a result of the bone deformities associated with maffucci syndrome, people with this disorder generally have short stature and underdeveloped muscles. maffucci syndrome is distinguished from a similar disorder that involves enchondromas (ollier disease) by the presence of red or purplish growths in the skin consisting of tangles of abnormal blood vessels (hemangiomas). in addition to hemangiomas, individuals with maffucci syndrome occasionally also have lymphangiomas, which are masses made up of the thin tubes that carry lymph fluid (lymphatic vessels). these growths may appear anywhere on the body. although the enchondromas associated with maffucci syndrome start out as benign, they may become cancerous (malignant). in particular, affected individuals may develop bone cancers called chondrosarcomas, especially in the skull. people with maffucci syndrome also have an increased risk of other cancers, such as ovarian or liver cancer. people with maffucci syndrome usually have a normal lifespan, and intelligence is unaffected. the extent of their physical impairment depends on their individual skeletal deformities, but in most cases they have no major limitations in their activities."
is pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome inherited ?,pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome is generally not inherited but arises from new (de novo) mutations that likely occur in early embryonic development.
how many people are affected by congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis ?,"cipa is a rare condition; however, the prevalence is unknown."
what are the genetic changes related to congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis ?,"mutations in the ntrk1 gene cause cipa. the ntrk1 gene provides instructions for making a receptor protein that attaches (binds) to another protein called ngf. the ntrk1 receptor is important for the survival of nerve cells (neurons). the ntrk1 receptor is found on the surface of cells, particularly neurons that transmit pain, temperature, and touch sensations (sensory neurons). when the ngf protein binds to the ntrk1 receptor, signals are transmitted inside the cell that tell the cell to grow and divide, and that help it survive. mutations in the ntrk1 gene lead to a protein that cannot transmit signals. without the proper signaling, neurons die by a process of self-destruction called apoptosis. loss of sensory neurons leads to the inability to feel pain in people with cipa. in addition, people with cipa lose the nerves leading to their sweat glands, which causes the anhidrosis seen in affected individuals."
what is (are) smith-lemli-opitz syndrome ?,"smith-lemli-opitz syndrome is a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body. this condition is characterized by distinctive facial features, small head size (microcephaly), intellectual disability or learning problems, and behavioral problems. many affected children have the characteristic features of autism, a developmental condition that affects communication and social interaction. malformations of the heart, lungs, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and genitalia are also common. infants with smith-lemli-opitz syndrome have weak muscle tone (hypotonia), experience feeding difficulties, and tend to grow more slowly than other infants. most affected individuals have fused second and third toes (syndactyly), and some have extra fingers or toes (polydactyly). the signs and symptoms of smith-lemli-opitz syndrome vary widely. mildly affected individuals may have only minor physical abnormalities with learning and behavioral problems. severe cases can be life-threatening and involve profound intellectual disability and major physical abnormalities."

what is (are) danon disease ?,"danon disease is a condition characterized by weakening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy); weakening of the muscles used for movement, called skeletal muscles, (myopathy); and intellectual disability. males with danon disease usually develop the condition earlier than females and are more severely affected. signs and symptoms begin in childhood or adolescence in most affected males and in early adulthood in most affected females. affected males, on average, live to age 19, while affected females live to an average age of 34. cardiomyopathy is the most common symptom of danon disease and occurs in all males with the condition. most affected men have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is a thickening of the heart muscle that may make it harder for the heart to pump blood. other affected males have dilated cardiomyopathy, which is a condition that weakens and enlarges the heart, preventing it from pumping blood efficiently. some affected men with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy later develop dilated cardiomyopathy. either type of cardiomyopathy can lead to heart failure and premature death. most women with danon disease also develop cardiomyopathy; of the women who have this feature, about half have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and the other half have dilated cardiomyopathy. affected individuals can have other heart-related signs and symptoms, including a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations), an abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia), or chest pain. many affected individuals have abnormalities of the electrical signals that control the heartbeat (conduction abnormalities). people with danon disease are often affected by a specific conduction abnormality known as cardiac preexcitation. the type of cardiac preexcitation most often seen in people with danon disease is called the wolff-parkinson-white syndrome pattern. skeletal myopathy occurs in most men with danon disease and about half of affected women. the weakness typically occurs in the muscles of the upper arms, shoulders, neck, and upper thighs. many males with danon disease have elevated levels of an enzyme called creatine kinase in their blood, which often indicates muscle disease. most men with danon disease, but only a small percentage of affected women, have intellectual disability. if present, the disability is usually mild. there can be other signs and symptoms of the condition in addition to the three characteristic features. several affected individuals have had gastrointestinal disease, breathing problems, or visual abnormalities."
is danon disease inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an x-linked dominant pattern. the gene associated with this condition is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in males (who have only one x chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder. in most cases, males experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons."
is early-onset glaucoma inherited ?,"early-onset glaucoma can have different inheritance patterns. primary congenital glaucoma is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. juvenile open-angle glaucoma is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in some families, primary congenital glaucoma may also be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern."
is oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy inherited ?,"most cases of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. people with autosomal dominant oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy have a mutation resulting in a pabpn1 protein with an expanded polyalanine tract of between 12 and 17 alanines. less commonly, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. in autosomal recessive oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, pabpn1 mutations lead to a polyalanine tract that is 11 alanines long. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."

what are the genetic changes related to charge syndrome ?,"mutations in the chd7 gene cause more than half of all cases of charge syndrome. the chd7 gene provides instructions for making a protein that most likely regulates gene activity (expression) by a process known as chromatin remodeling. chromatin is the complex of dna and protein that packages dna into chromosomes. the structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly dna is packaged. chromatin remodeling is one way gene expression is regulated during development. when dna is tightly packed, gene expression is lower than when dna is loosely packed. most mutations in the chd7 gene lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional chd7 protein, which presumably disrupts chromatin remodeling and the regulation of gene expression. changes in gene expression during embryonic development likely cause the signs and symptoms of charge syndrome. about one-third of individuals with charge syndrome do not have an identified mutation in the chd7 gene. researchers suspect that other genetic and environmental factors may be involved in these individuals."
is vitamin d-dependent rickets inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what is (are) trichohepatoenteric syndrome ?,"trichohepatoenteric syndrome is a condition that affects the hair (tricho-), liver (hepato-), and intestines (enteric), as well as other tissues and organs in the body. this condition is also known as syndromic diarrhea because chronic, difficult-to-treat diarrhea is one of its major features. within the first few weeks of life, affected infants develop watery diarrhea that occurs multiple times per day. even with nutritional support through intravenous feedings (parenteral nutrition), many of these children experience failure to thrive, which means they do not gain weight or grow at the expected rate. most children with trichohepatoenteric syndrome are small at birth, and they remain shorter than their peers throughout life. abnormal hair is another feature of trichohepatoenteric syndrome. hair in affected individuals is described as wooly, brittle, patchy, and easily pulled out. under a microscope, some strands of hair can be seen to vary in diameter, with thicker and thinner spots. this feature is known as trichorrhexis nodosa. other signs and symptoms of trichohepatoenteric syndrome can include liver disease; skin abnormalities; and distinctive facial features, including a wide forehead, a broad base of the nose, and widely spaced eyes. overall, the facial features are described as ""coarse."" most affected individuals also experience immune system abnormalities that can make them prone to developing infections. less commonly, trichohepatoenteric syndrome is associated with heart (cardiac) abnormalities. mild intellectual disability has been reported in at least half of all children with the condition. trichohepatoenteric syndrome is often life-threatening in childhood, particularly in children who develop liver disease or severe infections."
what are the genetic changes related to trichohepatoenteric syndrome ?,"trichohepatoenteric syndrome can be caused by mutations in the ttc37 or skiv2l gene. these genes provide instructions for making proteins whose functions have not been confirmed. researchers speculate that they work together with other proteins within cells to help recognize and break down excess or abnormal messenger rna (mrna) molecules. mrna is a chemical cousin of dna that serves as the genetic blueprint for protein production. studies suggest that getting rid of excess and abnormal mrna is important for cell growth. mutations in the ttc37 or skiv2l gene likely eliminate the function of their respective proteins, which is hypothesized to impair the breakdown of unneeded mrna. however, it is unknown how these changes could lead to chronic diarrhea and the other features of trichohepatoenteric syndrome."
what is (are) peutz-jeghers syndrome ?,"peutz-jeghers syndrome is characterized by the development of noncancerous growths called hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract (particularly the stomach and intestines) and a greatly increased risk of developing certain types of cancer. children with peutz-jeghers syndrome often develop small, dark-colored spots on the lips, around and inside the mouth, near the eyes and nostrils, and around the anus. these spots may also occur on the hands and feet. they appear during childhood and often fade as the person gets older. in addition, most people with peutz-jeghers syndrome develop multiple polyps in the stomach and intestines during childhood or adolescence. polyps can cause health problems such as recurrent bowel obstructions, chronic bleeding, and abdominal pain. people with peutz-jeghers syndrome have a high risk of developing cancer during their lifetimes. cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, cervix, ovary, and breast are among the most commonly reported tumors."
is peutz-jeghers syndrome inherited ?,"peutz-jeghers syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of developing noncancerous polyps and cancerous tumors. in about half of all cases, an affected person inherits a mutation in the stk11 gene from one affected parent. the remaining cases occur in people with no history of peutz-jeghers syndrome in their family. these cases appear to result from new (de novo) mutations in the stk11 gene."
is hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder."
"how many people are affected by 47,xyy syndrome ?","this condition occurs in about 1 in 1,000 newborn boys. five to 10 boys with 47,xyy syndrome are born in the united states each day."
what are the genetic changes related to myotonia congenita ?,"mutations in the clcn1 gene cause myotonia congenita. the clcn1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is critical for the normal function of skeletal muscle cells. for the body to move normally, skeletal muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. muscle contraction and relaxation are controlled by the flow of charged atoms (ions) into and out of muscle cells. specifically, the protein produced from the clcn1 gene forms a channel that controls the flow of negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions) into these cells. the main function of this channel is to stabilize the cells' electrical charge, which prevents muscles from contracting abnormally. mutations in the clcn1 gene alter the usual structure or function of chloride channels. the altered channels cannot properly regulate ion flow, reducing the movement of chloride ions into skeletal muscle cells. this disruption in chloride ion flow triggers prolonged muscle contractions, which are the hallmark of myotonia."
how many people are affected by beckwith-wiedemann syndrome ?,"beckwith-wiedemann syndrome affects an estimated 1 in 13,700 newborns worldwide. the condition may actually be more common than this estimate because some people with mild symptoms are never diagnosed."
what are the genetic changes related to pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 ?,"pha2 can be caused by mutations in the wnk1, wnk4, cul3, or klhl3 gene. these genes play a role in the regulation of blood pressure. the proteins produced from the wnk1 and wnk4 genes help control the amount of sodium and potassium in the body by regulating channels in the cell membrane that control the transport of sodium or potassium into and out of cells. this process primarily occurs in the kidneys. mutations in either of these genes disrupt control of these channels, leading to abnormal levels of sodium and potassium in the body. as a result, affected individuals develop hypertension and hyperkalemia. the proteins produced from the cul3 gene (called cullin-3) and the klhl3 gene help control the amount of wnk1 and wnk4 protein available. cullin-3 and klhl3 are two pieces of a complex, called an e3 ubiquitin ligase, that tags certain other proteins with molecules called ubiquitin. this molecule acts as a signal for the tagged protein to be broken down when it is no longer needed. e3 ubiquitin ligases containing cullin-3 and klhl3 are able to tag the wnk1 and wnk4 proteins with ubiquitin, leading to their breakdown. mutations in either the cul3 or klhl3 gene impair breakdown of the wnk4 protein. (the effect of these mutations on the wnk1 protein is unclear.) an excess of wnk4 likely disrupts control of sodium and potassium levels, resulting in hypertension and hyperkalemia."
what is (are) lennox-gastaut syndrome ?,"lennox-gastaut syndrome is a form of severe epilepsy that begins in childhood. it is characterized by multiple types of seizures and intellectual disability. people with lennox-gastaut syndrome begin having frequent seizures in early childhood, usually between ages 3 and 5. more than three-quarters of affected individuals have tonic seizures, which cause the muscles to stiffen (contract) uncontrollably. these seizures occur most often during sleep. also common are atypical absence seizures, which cause a partial or complete loss of consciousness. additionally, many affected individuals have drop attacks, which are sudden episodes of weak muscle tone. drop attacks can result in falls that cause serious or life-threatening injuries. other types of seizures have been reported less frequently in people with lennox-gastaut syndrome. most of the seizures associated with lennox-gastaut syndrome are very brief. however, more than two-thirds of affected individuals experience at least one prolonged period of seizure activity known as nonconvulsive status epilepticus. these episodes can cause confusion and a loss of alertness lasting from hours to weeks. almost all children with lennox-gastaut syndrome develop learning problems and intellectual disability associated with their frequent seizures. because the seizures associated with this condition are difficult to control with medication, the intellectual disability tends to worsen with time. some affected children develop additional neurological abnormalities and behavioral problems. many also have delayed development of motor skills such as sitting and crawling. as a result of their seizures and progressive intellectual disability, most people with lennox-gastaut syndrome require help with some or all of the usual activities of daily living. however, a small percentage of affected adults live independently. people with lennox-gastaut syndrome have an increased risk of death compared to their peers of the same age. although the increased risk is not fully understood, it is partly due to poorly controlled seizures and injuries from falls."
what are the genetic changes related to lennox-gastaut syndrome ?,"researchers have not identified any genes specific to lennox-gastaut syndrome, although the disorder likely has a genetic component. about two-thirds of cases are described as symptomatic, which means that they are related to an existing neurological problem. symptomatic lennox-gastaut syndrome can be associated with brain injuries that occur before or during birth, problems with blood flow in the developing brain, brain infections, or other disorders affecting the nervous system. the condition can also result from a brain malformation known as cortical dysplasia or occur as part of a genetic disorder called tuberous sclerosis complex. many people with lennox-gastaut syndrome have a history of recurrent seizures beginning in infancy (infantile spasms) or a related condition called west syndrome. in about one-third of cases, the cause of lennox-gastaut syndrome is unknown. when the disorder occurs without an apparent underlying reason, it is described as cryptogenic. individuals with cryptogenic lennox-gastaut syndrome have no history of epilepsy, neurological problems, or delayed development prior to the onset of the disorder."
what is (are) meier-gorlin syndrome ?,"meier-gorlin syndrome is a condition primarily characterized by short stature. it is considered a form of primordial dwarfism because the growth problems begin before birth (intrauterine growth retardation). after birth, affected individuals continue to grow at a slow rate. other characteristic features of this condition are underdeveloped or missing kneecaps (patellae), small ears, and, often, an abnormally small head (microcephaly). despite a small head size, most people with meier-gorlin syndrome have normal intellect. some people with meier-gorlin syndrome have other skeletal abnormalities, such as unusually narrow long bones in the arms and legs, a deformity of the knee joint that allows the knee to bend backwards (genu recurvatum), and slowed mineralization of bones (delayed bone age). most people with meier-gorlin syndrome have distinctive facial features. in addition to being abnormally small, the ears may be low-set or rotated backward. additional features can include a small mouth (microstomia), an underdeveloped lower jaw (micrognathia), full lips, and a narrow nose with a high nasal bridge. abnormalities in sexual development may also occur in meier-gorlin syndrome. in some males with this condition, the testes are small or undescended (cryptorchidism). affected females may have unusually small external genital folds (hypoplasia of the labia majora) and small breasts. both males and females with this condition can have sparse or absent underarm (axillary) hair. additional features of meier-gorlin syndrome can include difficulty feeding and a lung condition known as pulmonary emphysema or other breathing problems."
is androgenetic alopecia inherited ?,"the inheritance pattern of androgenetic alopecia is unclear because many genetic and environmental factors are likely to be involved. this condition tends to cluster in families, however, and having a close relative with patterned hair loss appears to be a risk factor for developing the condition."
what is (are) behet disease ?,"behet disease is an inflammatory condition that affects many parts of the body. the health problems associated with behet disease result from widespread inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis). this inflammation most commonly affects the mouth, genitals, skin, and eyes. painful mouth sores called aphthous ulcers are usually the first sign of behet disease. these sores occur on the lips and tongue and inside the cheeks. the ulcers look like common canker sores, and they typically heal within one to two weeks. about 75 percent of all people with behet disease develop similar ulcers on the genitals. these ulcers occur most frequently on the scrotum in men and on the labia in women. behet disease can also cause painful bumps and sores on the skin. most affected individuals develop pus-filled bumps that resemble acne. these bumps can occur anywhere on the body. some affected people also have red, tender nodules called erythema nodosum. these nodules usually develop on the legs but can also occur on the face, neck, and arms. an inflammation of the eye called uveitis is found in more than half of people with behet disease. eye problems are more common in younger people with the disease and affect men more often than women. uveitis can result in blurry vision and an extreme sensitivity to light (photophobia). rarely, inflammation can also cause eye pain and redness. if untreated, the eye problems associated with behet disease can lead to blindness. less commonly, behet disease can affect the joints, gastrointestinal tract, large blood vessels, and brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). central nervous system abnormalities are among the most serious complications of behet disease. related symptoms can include headaches, confusion, personality changes, memory loss, impaired speech, and problems with balance and movement. the signs and symptoms of behet disease usually begin in a person's twenties or thirties, although they can appear at any age. some affected people have relatively mild symptoms that are limited to sores in the mouth and on the genitals. others have more severe symptoms affecting many parts of the body, including the central nervous system. the features of behet disease typically come and go over a period of months or years. in most affected individuals, the health problems associated with this disorder improve with age."
how many people are affected by behet disease ?,"behet disease is most common in mediterranean countries, the middle east, japan, and other parts of asia. however, it has been found in populations worldwide. the highest prevalence of behet disease has been reported in turkey, where the disorder affects up to 420 in 100,000 people. the disorder is much less common in northern european countries and the united states, where it generally affects fewer than 1 in 100,000 people."
is behet disease inherited ?,"most cases of behet disease are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. a small percentage of all cases have been reported to run in families; however, the condition does not have a clear pattern of inheritance."

is juvenile primary osteoporosis inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder."
what are the genetic changes related to otopalatodigital syndrome type 2 ?,"mutations in the flna gene cause otopalatodigital syndrome type 2. the flna gene provides instructions for producing the protein filamin a, which helps build the network of protein filaments (cytoskeleton) that gives structure to cells and allows them to change shape and move. filamin a binds to another protein called actin, and helps the actin to form the branching network of filaments that make up the cytoskeleton. filamin a also links actin to many other proteins to perform various functions within the cell. a small number of mutations in the flna gene have been identified in people with otopalatodigital syndrome type 2. the mutations all result in changes to the filamin a protein in the region that binds to actin. the mutations responsible for otopalatodigital syndrome type 2 are described as ""gain-of-function"" because they appear to enhance the activity of the filamin a protein or give the protein a new, atypical function. researchers believe that the mutations may change the way the filamin a protein helps regulate processes involved in skeletal development, but it is not known how changes in the protein relate to the specific signs and symptoms of otopalatodigital syndrome type 2."
what is (are) parkinson disease ?,"parkinson disease is a progressive disorder of the nervous system. the disorder affects several regions of the brain, especially an area called the substantia nigra that controls balance and movement. often the first symptom of parkinson disease is trembling or shaking (tremor) of a limb, especially when the body is at rest. typically, the tremor begins on one side of the body, usually in one hand. tremors can also affect the arms, legs, feet, and face. other characteristic symptoms of parkinson disease include rigidity or stiffness of the limbs and torso, slow movement (bradykinesia) or an inability to move (akinesia), and impaired balance and coordination (postural instability). these symptoms worsen slowly over time. parkinson disease can also affect emotions and thinking ability (cognition). some affected individuals develop psychiatric conditions such as depression and visual hallucinations. people with parkinson disease also have an increased risk of developing dementia, which is a decline in intellectual functions including judgment and memory. generally, parkinson disease that begins after age 50 is called late-onset disease. the condition is described as early-onset disease if signs and symptoms begin before age 50. early-onset cases that begin before age 20 are sometimes referred to as juvenile-onset parkinson disease."
how many people are affected by congenital stromal corneal dystrophy ?,congenital stromal corneal dystrophy is probably very rare; only a few affected families have been reported in the medical literature.
what is (are) choroideremia ?,"choroideremia is a condition characterized by progressive vision loss that mainly affects males. the first symptom of this condition is usually an impairment of night vision (night blindness), which can occur in early childhood. a progressive narrowing of the field of vision (tunnel vision) follows, as well as a decrease in the ability to see details (visual acuity). these vision problems are due to an ongoing loss of cells (atrophy) in the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye (retina) and a nearby network of blood vessels (the choroid). the vision impairment in choroideremia worsens over time, but the progression varies among affected individuals. however, all individuals with this condition will develop blindness, most commonly in late adulthood."
what are the genetic changes related to congenital generalized lipodystrophy ?,"mutations in the agpat2, bscl2, cav1, and ptrf genes cause congenital generalized lipodystrophy types 1 through 4, respectively. the proteins produced from these genes play important roles in the development and function of adipocytes, which are the fat-storing cells in adipose tissue. mutations in any of these genes reduce or eliminate the function of their respective proteins, which impairs the development, structure, or function of adipocytes and makes the body unable to store and use fats properly. these abnormalities of adipose tissue disrupt hormones and affect many of the body's organs, resulting in the varied signs and symptoms of congenital generalized lipodystrophy. some of the genes associated with congenital generalized lipodystrophy also play roles in other cells and tissues. for example, the protein produced from the bscl2 gene is also present in the brain, although its function is unknown. a loss of this protein in the brain may help explain why congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 2 is sometimes associated with intellectual disability. in some people with congenital generalized lipodystrophy, no mutations have been found in any of the genes listed above. researchers are looking for additional genetic changes associated with this disorder."
is congenital generalized lipodystrophy inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what is (are) achromatopsia ?,"achromatopsia is a condition characterized by a partial or total absence of color vision. people with complete achromatopsia cannot perceive any colors; they see only black, white, and shades of gray. incomplete achromatopsia is a milder form of the condition that allows some color discrimination. achromatopsia also involves other problems with vision, including an increased sensitivity to light and glare (photophobia), involuntary back-and-forth eye movements (nystagmus), and significantly reduced sharpness of vision (low visual acuity). affected individuals can also have farsightedness (hyperopia) or, less commonly, nearsightedness (myopia). these vision problems develop in the first few months of life. achromatopsia is different from the more common forms of color vision deficiency (also called color blindness), in which people can perceive color but have difficulty distinguishing between certain colors, such as red and green."
is nager syndrome inherited ?,"most cases of nager syndrome are sporadic, which means that they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. less commonly, this condition has been found to run in families. when the disorder is familial, it can have an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder, although no genes have been associated with nager syndrome. in autosomal dominant nager syndrome, an affected person usually inherits the condition from one affected parent. autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of a gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of a mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. nager syndrome is thought to have an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern when unaffected parents have more than one affected child. the underlying genetic cause may differ among unrelated individuals with nager syndrome, even among those with the same pattern of inheritance."

what is (are) adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia ?,"adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (alsp) is a neurological condition characterized by changes to certain areas of the brain. a hallmark of alsp is leukoencephalopathy, which is the alteration of a type of brain tissue called white matter. white matter consists of nerve fibers (axons) covered by a substance called myelin that insulates and protects them. the axons extend from nerve cells (neurons) and transmit nerve impulses throughout the body. areas of damage to this brain tissue (white matter lesions) can be seen with magnetic resonance imaging (mri). another feature of alsp is swellings called spheroids in the axons of the brain, which are a sign of axon damage. also common in alsp are abnormally pigmented glial cells. glial cells are specialized brain cells that protect and maintain neurons. damage to myelin and neurons is thought to contribute to many of the neurological signs and symptoms in people with alsp. symptoms of alsp usually begin in a person's forties and worsen over time. personality changes, including depression and a loss of social inhibitions, are among the earliest symptoms of alsp. affected individuals may develop memory loss and loss of executive function, which is the ability to plan and implement actions and develop problem-solving strategies. loss of this function impairs skills such as impulse control, self-monitoring, and focusing attention appropriately. some people with alsp have mild seizures, usually only when the condition begins. as alsp progresses, it causes a severe decline in thinking and reasoning abilities (dementia). over time, motor skills are affected, and people with alsp may have difficulty walking. many develop a pattern of movement abnormalities known as parkinsonism, which includes unusually slow movement (bradykinesia), involuntary trembling (tremor), and muscle stiffness (rigidity). the pattern of cognitive and motor problems are variable, even among individuals in the same family, although almost all affected individuals ultimately become unable to walk, speak, and care for themselves. alsp was previously thought to be two separate conditions, hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (hdls) and familial pigmentary orthochromatic leukodystrophy (pold), both of which cause very similar white matter damage and cognitive and movement problems. pold was thought to be distinguished by the presence of pigmented glial cells and an absence of spheroids; however, people with hdls can have pigmented cells, too, and people with pold can have spheroids. hdls and pold are now considered to be part of the same disease spectrum, which researchers have recommended calling alsp."
how many people are affected by adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia ?,"alsp is thought to be a rare disorder, although the prevalence is unknown. because it can be mistaken for other disorders with similar symptoms, alsp may be underdiagnosed."
what is (are) ataxia-telangiectasia ?,"ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare inherited disorder that affects the nervous system, immune system, and other body systems. this disorder is characterized by progressive difficulty with coordinating movements (ataxia) beginning in early childhood, usually before age 5. affected children typically develop difficulty walking, problems with balance and hand coordination, involuntary jerking movements (chorea), muscle twitches (myoclonus), and disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy). the movement problems typically cause people to require wheelchair assistance by adolescence. people with this disorder also have slurred speech and trouble moving their eyes to look side-to-side (oculomotor apraxia). small clusters of enlarged blood vessels called telangiectases, which occur in the eyes and on the surface of the skin, are also characteristic of this condition. affected individuals tend to have high amounts of a protein called alpha-fetoprotein (afp) in their blood. the level of this protein is normally increased in the bloodstream of pregnant women, but it is unknown why individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia have elevated afp or what effects it has in these individuals. people with ataxia-telangiectasia often have a weakened immune system, and many develop chronic lung infections. they also have an increased risk of developing cancer, particularly cancer of blood-forming cells (leukemia) and cancer of immune system cells (lymphoma). affected individuals are very sensitive to the effects of radiation exposure, including medical x-rays. the life expectancy of people with ataxia-telangiectasia varies greatly, but affected individuals typically live into early adulthood."

what is (are) pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 ?,"pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (pha1) is a condition characterized by problems regulating the amount of sodium in the body. sodium regulation, which is important for blood pressure and fluid balance, primarily occurs in the kidneys. however, sodium can also be removed from the body through other tissues, such as the sweat glands and colon. pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 is named for its characteristic signs and symptoms, which mimic (pseudo) low levels (hypo) of a hormone called aldosterone that helps regulate sodium levels. however, people with pha1 have high levels of aldosterone. there are two types of pha1 distinguished by their severity, the genes involved, and how they are inherited. one type, called autosomal dominant pha1 (also known as renal pha1) is characterized by excessive sodium loss from the kidneys. this form of the condition is relatively mild and often improves in early childhood. the other type, called autosomal recessive pha1 (also known as generalized or systemic pha1) is characterized by sodium loss from the kidneys and other organs, including the sweat glands, salivary glands, and colon. this type of pha1 is more severe and does not improve with age. the earliest signs of both types of pha1 are usually the inability to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive) and dehydration, which are typically seen in infants. the characteristic features of both types of pha1 are excessive amounts of sodium released in the urine (salt wasting), which leads to low levels of sodium in the blood (hyponatremia), and high levels of potassium in the blood (hyperkalemia). infants with pha1 can also have high levels of acid in the blood (metabolic acidosis). hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, or metabolic acidosis can cause nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, extreme tiredness (fatigue), and muscle weakness in infants with pha1. infants with autosomal recessive pha1 can have additional signs and symptoms due to the involvement of multiple organs. affected individuals may experience episodes of abnormal heartbeat (cardiac arrhythmia) or shock because of the imbalance of salts in the body. they may also have recurrent lung infections or lesions on the skin. although adults with autosomal recessive pha1 can have repeated episodes of salt wasting, they do not usually have other signs and symptoms of the condition."
what are the genetic changes related to pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 ?,"mutations in one of four different genes involved in sodium regulation cause autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pha1. mutations in the nr3c2 gene cause autosomal dominant pha1. this gene provides instructions for making the mineralocorticoid receptor protein. mutations in the scnn1a, scnn1b, or scnn1g genes cause autosomal recessive pha1. each of these three genes provides instructions for making one of the pieces (subunits) of a protein complex called the epithelial sodium channel (enac). the mineralocorticoid receptor regulates specialized proteins in the cell membrane that control the transport of sodium or potassium into cells. in response to signals that sodium levels are low, such as the presence of the hormone aldosterone, the mineralocorticoid receptor increases the number and activity of these proteins at the cell membrane of certain kidney cells. one of these proteins is enac, which transports sodium into the cell; another protein simultaneously transports sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell. these proteins help keep sodium in the body through a process called reabsorption and remove potassium from the body through a process called secretion. mutations in the nr3c2 gene lead to a nonfunctional or abnormally functioning mineralocorticoid receptor protein that cannot properly regulate the specialized proteins that transport sodium and potassium. as a result, sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion are both decreased, causing hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. mutations in the scnn1a, scnn1b, and scnn1g genes result in reduced functioning or nonfunctioning enac channels. as in autosomal dominant pha1, the reduction or absence of enac function in the kidneys leads to hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. in addition, nonfunctional enac channels in other body systems lead to additional signs and symptoms of autosomal recessive pha1, including lung infections and skin lesions."
what are the genetic changes related to autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness ?,"mutations in several genes can cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness. each of these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are found in the retina. these proteins are involved in sending (transmitting) visual signals from cells called rods, which are specialized for vision in low light, to cells called bipolar cells, which relay the signals to other retinal cells. this signaling is an essential step in the transmission of visual information from the eyes to the brain. mutations in two genes, grm6 and trpm1, cause most cases of this condition. these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are necessary for bipolar cells to receive and relay signals. mutations in other genes involved in the same bipolar cell signaling pathway are likely responsible for a small percentage of cases of autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness. gene mutations that cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness disrupt the transmission of visual signals between rod cells and bipolar cells or interfere with the bipolar cells' ability to pass on these signals. as a result, visual information received by rod cells cannot be effectively transmitted to the brain, leading to difficulty seeing in low light. the cause of the other vision problems associated with this condition is unclear. it has been suggested that the mechanisms that underlie night blindness can interfere with other visual systems, causing myopia, reduced visual acuity, and other impairments. some people with autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness have no identified mutation in any of the known genes. the cause of the disorder in these individuals is unknown."

what is (are) craniometaphyseal dysplasia ?,"craniometaphyseal dysplasia is a rare condition characterized by progressive thickening of bones in the skull (cranium) and abnormalities at the ends of long bones in the limbs (metaphyseal dysplasia). except in the most severe cases, the lifespan of people with craniometaphyseal dysplasia is normal. bone overgrowth in the head causes many of the signs and symptoms of craniometaphyseal dysplasia. affected individuals typically have distinctive facial features such as a wide nasal bridge, a prominent forehead, wide-set eyes (hypertelorism), and a prominent jaw. excessive new bone formation (hyperostosis) in the jaw can delay teething (dentition) or result in absent (non-erupting) teeth. infants with this condition may have breathing or feeding problems caused by narrow nasal passages. in severe cases, abnormal bone growth can compress the nerves that emerge from the brain and extend to various areas of the head and neck (cranial nerves). compression of the cranial nerves can lead to paralyzed facial muscles (facial nerve palsy), blindness, or deafness. the x-rays of individuals with craniometaphyseal dysplasia show unusually shaped long bones, particularly the large bones in the legs. the ends of these bones (metaphyses) are wider and appear less dense in people with this condition. there are two types of craniometaphyseal dysplasia, which are distinguished by their pattern of inheritance. they are known as the autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive types. autosomal recessive craniometaphyseal dysplasia is typically more severe than the autosomal dominant form."

what are the genetic changes related to intranuclear rod myopathy ?,"intranuclear rod myopathy is caused by a mutation in the acta1 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called skeletal alpha ()-actin, which is part of the actin protein family. actin proteins are important for cell movement and the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction). thin filaments made up of actin molecules and thick filaments made up of another protein called myosin are the primary components of muscle fibers and are important for muscle contraction. attachment (binding) and release of the overlapping thick and thin filaments allows them to move relative to each other so that the muscles can contract. acta1 gene mutations that cause intranuclear rod myopathy result in the accumulation of rods of skeletal -actin in the nucleus of muscle cells. normally, most actin is found in the fluid surrounding the nucleus (the cytoplasm), with small amounts in the nucleus itself. researchers suggest that the acta1 gene mutations that cause intranuclear rod myopathy may interfere with the normal transport of actin between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, resulting in the accumulation of actin in the nucleus and the formation of intranuclear rods. abnormal accumulation of actin in the nucleus of muscle cells and a corresponding reduction of available actin in muscle fibers may impair muscle contraction and lead to the muscle weakness seen in intranuclear rod myopathy. in some people with intranuclear rod myopathy, no acta1 gene mutations have been identified. the cause of the disorder in these individuals is unknown."
what are the genetic changes related to prion disease ?,"between 10 and 15 percent of all cases of prion disease are caused by mutations in the prnp gene. because they can run in families, these forms of prion disease are classified as familial. familial prion diseases, which have overlapping signs and symptoms, include familial creutzfeldt-jakob disease (cjd), gerstmann-strussler-scheinker syndrome (gss), and fatal familial insomnia (ffi). the prnp gene provides instructions for making a protein called prion protein (prp). although the precise function of this protein is unknown, researchers have proposed roles in several important processes. these include the transport of copper into cells, protection of brain cells (neurons) from injury (neuroprotection), and communication between neurons. in familial forms of prion disease, prnp gene mutations result in the production of an abnormally shaped protein, known as prpsc, from one copy of the gene. in a process that is not fully understood, prpsc can attach (bind) to the normal protein (prpc) and promote its transformation into prpsc. the abnormal protein builds up in the brain, forming clumps that damage or destroy neurons. the loss of these cells creates microscopic sponge-like holes (vacuoles) in the brain, which leads to the signs and symptoms of prion disease. the other 85 to 90 percent of cases of prion disease are classified as either sporadic or acquired. people with sporadic prion disease have no family history of the disease and no identified mutation in the prnp gene. sporadic disease occurs when prpc spontaneously, and for unknown reasons, is transformed into prpsc. sporadic forms of prion disease include sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease (scjd), sporadic fatal insomnia (sfi), and variably protease-sensitive prionopathy (vpspr). acquired prion disease results from exposure to prpsc from an outside source. for example, variant creutzfeldt-jakob disease (vcjd) is a type of acquired prion disease in humans that results from eating beef products containing prpsc from cattle with prion disease. in cows, this form of the disease is known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (bse) or, more commonly, ""mad cow disease."" another example of an acquired human prion disease is kuru, which was identified in the south fore population in papua new guinea. the disorder was transmitted when individuals ate affected human tissue during cannibalistic funeral rituals. rarely, prion disease can be transmitted by accidental exposure to prpsc-contaminated tissues during a medical procedure. this type of prion disease, which accounts for 1 to 2 percent of all cases, is classified as iatrogenic."

what are the genetic changes related to mckusick-kaufman syndrome ?,"mutations in the mkks gene cause mckusick-kaufman syndrome. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in the formation of the limbs, heart, and reproductive system. the protein's structure suggests that it may act as a chaperonin, which is a type of protein that helps fold other proteins. proteins must be folded into the correct 3-dimensional shape to perform their usual functions in the body. although the structure of the mkks protein is similar to that of a chaperonin, some recent studies have suggested that protein folding may not be this protein's primary function. researchers speculate that the mkks protein also may be involved in transporting other proteins within the cell. the mutations that underlie mckusick-kaufman syndrome alter the structure of the mkks protein. although the altered protein disrupts the development of several parts of the body before birth, it is unclear how mkks mutations lead to the specific features of this disorder."
is essential tremor inherited ?,"essential tremor can be passed through generations in families, but the inheritance pattern varies. in most affected families, essential tremor appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder, although no genes that cause essential tremor have been identified. in other families, the inheritance pattern is unclear. essential tremor may also appear in people with no history of the disorder in their family. in some families, some individuals have essential tremor while others have other movement disorders, such as involuntary muscle tensing (dystonia). the potential genetic connection between essential tremor and other movement disorders is an active area of research."

what is (are) hashimoto thyroiditis ?,"hashimoto thyroiditis is a condition that affects the function of the thyroid, which is a butterfly-shaped gland in the lower neck. the thyroid makes hormones that help regulate a wide variety of critical body functions. for example, thyroid hormones influence growth and development, body temperature, heart rate, menstrual cycles, and weight. hashimoto thyroiditis is a form of chronic inflammation that can damage the thyroid, reducing its ability to produce hormones. one of the first signs of hashimoto thyroiditis is an enlargement of the thyroid called a goiter. depending on its size, the enlarged thyroid can cause the neck to look swollen and may interfere with breathing and swallowing. as damage to the thyroid continues, the gland can shrink over a period of years and the goiter may eventually disappear. other signs and symptoms resulting from an underactive thyroid can include excessive tiredness (fatigue), weight gain or difficulty losing weight, hair that is thin and dry, a slow heart rate, joint or muscle pain, and constipation. people with this condition may also have a pale, puffy face and feel cold even when others around them are warm. affected women can have heavy or irregular menstrual periods and difficulty conceiving a child (impaired fertility). difficulty concentrating and depression can also be signs of a shortage of thyroid hormones. hashimoto thyroiditis usually appears in mid-adulthood, although it can occur earlier or later in life. its signs and symptoms tend to develop gradually over months or years."
what are the genetic changes related to hashimoto thyroiditis ?,"hashimoto thyroiditis is thought to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. some of these factors have been identified, but many remain unknown. hashimoto thyroiditis is classified as an autoimmune disorder, one of a large group of conditions that occur when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. in people with hashimoto thyroiditis, white blood cells called lymphocytes accumulate abnormally in the thyroid, which can damage it. the lymphocytes make immune system proteins called antibodies that attack and destroy thyroid cells. when too many thyroid cells become damaged or die, the thyroid can no longer make enough hormones to regulate body functions. this shortage of thyroid hormones underlies the signs and symptoms of hashimoto thyroiditis. however, some people with thyroid antibodies never develop hypothyroidism or experience any related signs or symptoms. people with hashimoto thyroiditis have an increased risk of developing other autoimmune disorders, including vitiligo, rheumatoid arthritis, addison disease, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and pernicious anemia. variations in several genes have been studied as possible risk factors for hashimoto thyroiditis. some of these genes are part of a family called the human leukocyte antigen (hla) complex. the hla complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). other genes that have been associated with hashimoto thyroiditis help regulate the immune system or are involved in normal thyroid function. most of the genetic variations that have been discovered are thought to have a small impact on a person's overall risk of developing this condition. other, nongenetic factors also play a role in hashimoto thyroiditis. these factors may trigger the condition in people who are at risk, although the mechanism is unclear. potential triggers include changes in sex hormones (particularly in women), viral infections, certain medications, exposure to ionizing radiation, and excess consumption of iodine (a substance involved in thyroid hormone production)."

what are the genetic changes related to combined pituitary hormone deficiency ?,"mutations in at least eight genes have been found to cause combined pituitary hormone deficiency. mutations in the prop1 gene are the most common known cause of this disorder, accounting for an estimated 12 to 55 percent of cases. mutations in other genes have each been identified in a smaller number of affected individuals. the genes associated with combined pituitary hormone deficiency provide instructions for making proteins called transcription factors, which help control the activity of many other genes. the proteins are involved in the development of the pituitary gland and the specialization (differentiation) of its cell types. the cells of the pituitary gland are responsible for triggering the release of several hormones that direct the development of many parts of the body. some of the transcription factors are found only in the pituitary gland, and some are also active in other parts of the body. mutations in the genes associated with combined pituitary hormone deficiency can result in abnormal differentiation of pituitary gland cells and may prevent the production of several hormones. these hormones can include growth hormone (gh), which is needed for normal growth; follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh) and luteinizing hormone (lh), which both play a role in sexual development and the ability to have children (fertility); thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh), which helps with thyroid gland function; prolactin, which stimulates the production of breast milk; and adrenocorticotropic hormone (acth), which influences energy production in the body and maintains normal blood sugar and blood pressure levels. the degree to which these hormones are deficient is variable, with prolactin and acth showing the most variability. in many affected individuals, acth deficiency does not occur until late adulthood. most people with combined pituitary hormone deficiency do not have identified mutations in any of the genes known to be associated with this condition. the cause of the disorder in these individuals is unknown."
is african iron overload inherited ?,"african iron overload seems to run in families, and high iron in a family's diet seems to be the major contributor to development of the condition. there also may be a genetic contribution, but the inheritance pattern is unknown. people with a specific variation in the slc40a1 gene may inherit an increased risk of this condition, but not the condition itself. not all people with this condition have the variation in the gene, and not all people with the variation will develop the disorder."
what is (are) hypochondrogenesis ?,"hypochondrogenesis is a rare, severe disorder of bone growth. this condition is characterized by a small body, short limbs, and abnormal bone formation (ossification) in the spine and pelvis. affected infants have short arms and legs, a small chest with short ribs, and underdeveloped lungs. bones in the skull develop normally, but the bones of the spine (vertebrae) and pelvis do not harden (ossify) properly. the face appears flat and oval-shaped, with widely spaced eyes, a small chin, and, in some cases, an opening in the roof of the mouth called a cleft palate. individuals with hypochondrogenesis have an enlarged abdomen and may have a condition called hydrops fetalis in which excess fluid builds up in the body before birth. as a result of these serious health problems, some affected fetuses do not survive to term. infants born with hypochondrogenesis usually die at birth or shortly thereafter from respiratory failure. babies who live past the newborn period are usually reclassified as having spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, a related but milder disorder that similarly affects bone development."

what are the genetic changes related to paramyotonia congenita ?,"mutations in the scn4a gene cause paramyotonia congenita. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that is critical for the normal function of skeletal muscle cells. for the body to move normally, skeletal muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. muscle contractions are triggered by the flow of positively charged atoms (ions), including sodium, into skeletal muscle cells. the scn4a protein forms channels that control the flow of sodium ions into these cells. mutations in the scn4a gene alter the usual structure and function of sodium channels. the altered channels cannot effectively regulate the flow of sodium ions into skeletal muscle cells. the resulting increase in ion flow interferes with normal muscle contraction and relaxation, leading to episodes of muscle stiffness and weakness."

what is (are) acromicric dysplasia ?,"acromicric dysplasia is a condition characterized by severely short stature, short limbs, stiff joints, and distinctive facial features. newborns with acromicric dysplasia are of normal size, but slow growth over time results in short stature. the average height of adults with this disorder is about 4 feet, 2 inches for women and 4 feet, 5 inches for men. the long bones of the arms and legs, and the bones in the hands and feet, are shorter than would be expected for the individual's height. other skeletal features that occur in this disorder include slowed mineralization of bone (delayed bone age), abnormally shaped bones of the spine (vertebrae), and constrained movement of joints. affected individuals often develop carpal tunnel syndrome, which is characterized by numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hands and fingers. a misalignment of the hip joints (hip dysplasia) can also occur in this disorder. these skeletal and joint problems may require treatment, but most affected individuals have few limitations in their activities. children with acromicric dysplasia may have a round face, sharply defined eyebrows, long eyelashes, a bulbous nose with upturned nostrils, a long space between the nose and upper lip (philtrum), and a small mouth with thick lips. these facial differences become less apparent in adulthood. intelligence is unaffected in this disorder, and life expectancy is generally normal."
what is (are) cranioectodermal dysplasia ?,"cranioectodermal dysplasia is a disorder that affects many parts of the body. the most common features involve bone abnormalities and abnormal development of certain tissues known as ectodermal tissues, which include the skin, hair, nails, and teeth. the signs and symptoms of this condition vary among affected individuals, even among members of the same family. distinctive abnormalities of the skull and face are common in people with cranioectodermal dysplasia. most affected individuals have a prominent forehead (frontal bossing) and an elongated head (dolichocephaly) due to abnormal fusion of certain skull bones (sagittal craniosynostosis). a variety of facial abnormalities can occur in people with this condition; these include low-set ears that may also be rotated backward, an increased distance between the inner corners of the eyes (telecanthus), and outside corners of the eyes that point upward or downward (upslanting or downslanting palpebral fissures) among others. development of bones in the rest of the skeleton is also affected in this condition. abnormalities in the long bones of the arms and legs (metaphyseal dysplasia) lead to short limbs and short stature. in addition, affected individuals often have short fingers (brachydactyly). some people with this condition have short rib bones and a narrow rib cage, which can cause breathing problems, especially in affected newborns. abnormal development of ectodermal tissues in people with cranioectodermal dysplasia can lead to sparse hair, small or missing teeth, short fingernails and toenails, and loose skin. cranioectodermal dysplasia can affect additional organs and tissues in the body. a kidney disorder known as nephronophthisis occurs in many people with this condition, and it can lead to a life-threatening failure of kidney function known as end-stage renal disease. abnormalities of the liver, heart, or eyes also occur in people with cranioectodermal dysplasia."

what is (are) menkes syndrome ?,"menkes syndrome is a disorder that affects copper levels in the body. it is characterized by sparse, kinky hair; failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive); and deterioration of the nervous system. additional signs and symptoms include weak muscle tone (hypotonia), sagging facial features, seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. children with menkes syndrome typically begin to develop symptoms during infancy and often do not live past age 3. early treatment with copper may improve the prognosis in some affected individuals. in rare cases, symptoms begin later in childhood. occipital horn syndrome (sometimes called x-linked cutis laxa) is a less severe form of menkes syndrome that begins in early to middle childhood. it is characterized by wedge-shaped calcium deposits in a bone at the base of the skull (the occipital bone), coarse hair, and loose skin and joints."
is menkes syndrome inherited ?,"menkes syndrome is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. the gene associated with this condition is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by x-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons. in about one-third of cases, menkes syndrome is caused by new mutations in the atp7a gene. people with a new mutation do not have a history of the disorder in their family."
is progressive osseous heteroplasia inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. people normally inherit one copy of each gene from their mother and one copy from their father. for most genes, both copies are active, or ""turned on,"" in all cells. for a small subset of genes, however, only one of the two copies is active. for some of these genes, only the copy inherited from a person's father (the paternal copy) is active, while for other genes, only the copy inherited from a person's mother (the maternal copy) is active. these differences in gene activation based on the gene's parent of origin are caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting. the gnas gene has a complex genomic imprinting pattern. in some cells of the body the maternal copy of the gene is active, while in others the paternal copy is active. progressive osseous heteroplasia occurs when mutations affect the paternal copy of the gene."

what are the genetic changes related to spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 ?,"mutations in the cacna1a gene cause sca6. the cacna1a gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms a part of some calcium channels. these channels transport positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) across cell membranes. the movement of these ions is critical for normal signaling between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and other parts of the nervous system. the cacna1a gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha-1 subunit) of a calcium channel called cav2.1. cav2.1 channels play an essential role in communication between neurons in the brain. the cacna1a gene mutations that cause sca6 involve a dna segment known as a cag trinucleotide repeat. this segment is made up of a series of three dna building blocks (cytosine, adenine, and guanine) that appear multiple times in a row. normally, the cag segment is repeated 4 to 18 times within the gene. in people with sca6, the cag segment is repeated 20 to 33 times. people with 20 repeats tend to experience signs and symptoms of sca6 beginning in late adulthood, while people with a larger number of repeats usually have signs and symptoms from mid-adulthood. an increase in the length of the cag segment leads to the production of an abnormally long version of the alpha-1 subunit. this version of the subunit alters the location and function of the cav2.1 channels. normally the alpha-1 subunit is located within the cell membrane; the abnormal subunit is found in the cell membrane as well as in the fluid inside cells (cytoplasm), where it clusters together and forms clumps (aggregates). the effect these aggregates have on cell functioning is unknown. the lack of normal calcium channels in the cell membrane impairs cell communication between neurons in the brain. diminished cell communication leads to cell death. cells within the cerebellum, which is the part of the brain that coordinates movement, are particularly sensitive to the accumulation of these aggregates. over time, a loss of cells in the cerebellum causes the movement problems characteristic of sca6."
what is (are) cole disease ?,"cole disease is a disorder that affects the skin. people with this disorder have areas of unusually light-colored skin (hypopigmentation), typically on the arms and legs, and spots of thickened skin on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet (punctate palmoplantar keratoderma). these skin features are present at birth or develop in the first year of life. in some cases, individuals with cole disease develop abnormal accumulations of the mineral calcium (calcifications) in the tendons, which can cause pain during movement. calcifications may also occur in the skin or breast tissue."

"what are the genetic changes related to platyspondylic lethal skeletal dysplasia, torrance type ?","platyspondylic lethal skeletal dysplasia, torrance type is one of a spectrum of skeletal disorders caused by mutations in the col2a1 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms type ii collagen. this type of collagen is found mostly in the clear gel that fills the eyeball (the vitreous) and in cartilage. cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. most cartilage is later converted to bone, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears. type ii collagen is essential for the normal development of bones and other connective tissues that form the body's supportive framework. all of the col2a1 mutations that have been found to cause platyspondylic lethal skeletal dysplasia, torrance type occur in a region of the protein called the c-propeptide domain. these mutations interfere with the assembly of type ii collagen molecules, reducing the amount of this type of collagen in the body. instead of forming collagen molecules, the abnormal col2a1 protein builds up in cartilage cells (chondrocytes). these changes disrupt the normal development of bones and other connective tissues, leading to the skeletal abnormalities characteristic of platyspondylic lethal skeletal dysplasia, torrance type."

how many people are affected by usher syndrome ?,"usher syndrome is thought to be responsible for 3 percent to 6 percent of all childhood deafness and about 50 percent of deaf-blindness in adults. usher syndrome type i is estimated to occur in at least 4 per 100,000 people. it may be more common in certain ethnic populations, such as people with ashkenazi (central and eastern european) jewish ancestry and the acadian population in louisiana. type ii is thought to be the most common form of usher syndrome, although the frequency of this type is unknown. type iii usher syndrome accounts for only a small percentage of all usher syndrome cases in most populations. this form of the condition is more common in the finnish population, however, where it accounts for about 40 percent of all cases."
what are the genetic changes related to mal de meleda ?,"mal de meleda is caused by mutations in the slurp1 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that interacts with other proteins, called receptors, and is likely involved in signaling within cells. studies show that the slurp-1 protein can attach (bind) to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs) in the skin. through interaction with these receptors, the slurp-1 protein is thought to be involved in controlling the growth and division (proliferation), maturation (differentiation), and survival of skin cells. mutations in the slurp1 gene lead to little or no slurp-1 protein in the body. it is unclear how a lack of this protein leads to the skin problems that occur in mal de meleda. researchers speculate that without slurp-1, the activity of genes controlled by nachr signaling is altered, leading to overgrowth of skin cells or survival of cells that normally would have died. the excess of cells can result in skin thickening. it is unclear why skin on the hands and feet is particularly affected."

what are the genetic changes related to fragile x-associated primary ovarian insufficiency ?,"mutations in the fmr1 gene increase a woman's risk of developing fxpoi. the fmr1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called fmrp, which helps regulate the production of other proteins. this protein plays a role in the functioning of nerve cells. it is also important for normal ovarian function, although the role is not fully understood. women with fxpoi have a mutation in which a dna segment, known as a cgg triplet repeat, is expanded within the fmr1 gene. normally, this dna segment is repeated from 5 to about 40 times. in women with fxpoi, however, the cgg segment is repeated 55 to 200 times. this mutation is known as an fmr1 gene premutation. some studies show that women with about 44 to 54 cgg repeats, known as an intermediate (or gray zone) mutation, can also have features of fxpoi. an expansion of more than 200 repeats, a full mutation, causes a more serious disorder called fragile x syndrome, which is characterized by intellectual disability, learning problems, and certain physical features. for unknown reasons, the premutation leads to the overproduction of abnormal fmr1 mrna that contains the expanded repeat region. the fmr1 mrna is the genetic blueprint for fmrp. researchers believe that the high levels of mrna cause the signs and symptoms of fxpoi. it is thought that the mrna attaches to other proteins and keeps them from performing their functions. in addition, the repeats make producing fmrp from the blueprint more difficult, and as a result, people with the fmr1 gene premutation can have less fmrp than normal. a reduction of this protein is not thought to be involved in fxpoi. however, it may cause mild versions of the features seen in fragile x syndrome, such as prominent ears, anxiety, and mood swings."

what is (are) thiopurine s-methyltransferase deficiency ?,"thiopurine s-methyltransferase (tpmt) deficiency is a condition characterized by significantly reduced activity of an enzyme that helps the body process drugs called thiopurines. these drugs, which include 6-thioguanine, 6-mercaptopurine, and azathioprine, inhibit (suppress) the body's immune system. thiopurine drugs are used to treat some autoimmune disorders, including crohn disease and rheumatoid arthritis, which occur when the immune system malfunctions. these drugs are also used to treat several forms of cancer, particularly cancers of blood-forming tissue (leukemias) and cancers of immune system cells (lymphomas). additionally, thiopurine drugs are used in organ transplant recipients to help prevent the immune system from attacking the transplanted organ. a potential complication of treatment with thiopurine drugs is damage to the bone marrow (hematopoietic toxicity). although this complication can occur in anyone who takes these drugs, people with tpmt deficiency are at highest risk. bone marrow normally makes several types of blood cells, including red blood cells, which carry oxygen; white blood cells, which help protect the body from infection; and platelets, which are involved in blood clotting. damage to the bone marrow results in myelosuppression, a condition in which the bone marrow is unable to make enough of these cells. a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) can cause pale skin (pallor), weakness, shortness of breath, and extreme tiredness (fatigue). low numbers of white blood cells (neutropenia) can lead to frequent and potentially life-threatening infections. a shortage of platelets (thrombocytopenia) can cause easy bruising and bleeding. many healthcare providers recommend that patients' tpmt activity levels be tested before thiopurine drugs are prescribed. in people who are found to have reduced enzyme activity, the drugs may be given at a significantly lower dose or different medications can be used to reduce the risk of hematopoietic toxicity. tpmt deficiency does not appear to cause any health problems other than those associated with thiopurine drug treatment."
how many people are affected by 7q11.23 duplication syndrome ?,"the prevalence of this disorder is estimated to be 1 in 7,500 to 20,000 people."
what are the genetic changes related to 7q11.23 duplication syndrome ?,"7q11.23 duplication syndrome results from an extra copy of a region on the long (q) arm of chromosome 7 in each cell. this region is called the williams-beuren syndrome critical region (wbscr) because its deletion causes a different disorder called williams syndrome, also known as williams-beuren syndrome. the region, which is 1.5 to 1.8 million dna base pairs (mb) in length, includes 26 to 28 genes. extra copies of several of the genes in the duplicated region, including the eln and gtf2i genes, likely contribute to the characteristic features of 7q11.23 duplication syndrome. researchers suggest that an extra copy of the eln gene in each cell may be related to the increased risk for aortic dilatation in 7q11.23 duplication syndrome. studies suggest that an extra copy of the gtf2i gene may be associated with some of the behavioral features of the disorder. however, the specific causes of these features are unclear. researchers are studying additional genes in the duplicated region, but none have been definitely linked to any of the specific signs or symptoms of 7q11.23 duplication syndrome."
is 7q11.23 duplication syndrome inherited ?,"7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. these cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent."
what is (are) 22q11.2 deletion syndrome ?,"22q11.2 deletion syndrome (which is also known by several other names, listed below) is a disorder caused by the deletion of a small piece of chromosome 22. the deletion occurs near the middle of the chromosome at a location designated q11.2. 22q11.2 deletion syndrome has many possible signs and symptoms that can affect almost any part of the body. the features of this syndrome vary widely, even among affected members of the same family. common signs and symptoms include heart abnormalities that are often present from birth, an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and distinctive facial features. people with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome often experience recurrent infections caused by problems with the immune system, and some develop autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and graves disease in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. affected individuals may also have breathing problems, kidney abnormalities, low levels of calcium in the blood (which can result in seizures), a decrease in blood platelets (thrombocytopenia), significant feeding difficulties, gastrointestinal problems, and hearing loss. skeletal differences are possible, including mild short stature and, less frequently, abnormalities of the spinal bones. many children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome have developmental delays, including delayed growth and speech development, and learning disabilities. later in life, they are at an increased risk of developing mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. additionally, affected children are more likely than children without 22q11.2 deletion syndrome to have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) and developmental conditions such as autism spectrum disorders that affect communication and social interaction. because the signs and symptoms of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are so varied, different groupings of features were once described as separate conditions. doctors named these conditions digeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome (also called shprintzen syndrome), and conotruncal anomaly face syndrome. in addition, some children with the 22q11.2 deletion were diagnosed with the autosomal dominant form of opitz g/bbb syndrome and cayler cardiofacial syndrome. once the genetic basis for these disorders was identified, doctors determined that they were all part of a single syndrome with many possible signs and symptoms. to avoid confusion, this condition is usually called 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, a description based on its underlying genetic cause."

how many people are affected by diastrophic dysplasia ?,"although the exact incidence of this condition is unknown, researchers estimate that it affects about 1 in 100,000 newborns. diastrophic dysplasia occurs in all populations but appears to be particularly common in finland."
is diastrophic dysplasia inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what are the genetic changes related to multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome ?,"multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome can be caused by mutations in the nfu1 or bola3 gene. the proteins produced from each of these genes appear to be involved in the formation of molecules called iron-sulfur (fe-s) clusters or in the attachment of these clusters to other proteins. certain proteins require attachment of fe-s clusters to function properly. the nfu-1 and bola3 proteins play an important role in mitochondria. in these structures, several proteins carry out a series of chemical steps to convert the energy in food into a form that cells can use. many of the proteins involved in these steps require fe-s clusters to function, including protein complexes called complex i, complex ii, and complex iii. fe-s clusters are also required for another mitochondrial protein to function; this protein is involved in the modification of additional proteins that aid in energy production in mitochondria, including the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (also known as the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex). this modification is also critical to the function of the glycine cleavage system, a set of proteins that breaks down a protein building block (amino acid) called glycine when levels become too high. mutations in the nfu1 or bola3 gene reduce or eliminate production of the respective protein, which impairs fe-s cluster formation. consequently, proteins affected by the presence of fe-s clusters, including those involved in energy production and glycine breakdown, cannot function normally. reduced activity of complex i, ii, or iii, pyruvate dehydrogenase, or alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase leads to potentially fatal lactic acidosis, encephalopathy, and other signs and symptoms of multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome. in some affected individuals, impairment of the glycine cleavage system leads to a buildup of glycine."
what are the genetic changes related to sandhoff disease ?,"mutations in the hexb gene cause sandhoff disease. the hexb gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of two critical enzymes in the nervous system, beta-hexosaminidase a and beta-hexosaminidase b. these enzymes are located in lysosomes, which are structures in cells that break down toxic substances and act as recycling centers. within lysosomes, these enzymes break down fatty substances, complex sugars, and molecules that are linked to sugars. in particular, beta-hexosaminidase a helps break down a fatty substance called gm2 ganglioside. mutations in the hexb gene disrupt the activity of beta-hexosaminidase a and beta-hexosaminidase b, which prevents these enzymes from breaking down gm2 ganglioside and other molecules. as a result, these compounds can accumulate to toxic levels, particularly in neurons of the brain and spinal cord. a buildup of gm2 ganglioside leads to the progressive destruction of these neurons, which causes many of the signs and symptoms of sandhoff disease. because sandhoff disease impairs the function of lysosomal enzymes and involves the buildup of gm2 ganglioside, this condition is sometimes referred to as a lysosomal storage disorder or a gm2-gangliosidosis."
what is (are) spondyloperipheral dysplasia ?,"spondyloperipheral dysplasia is a disorder that impairs bone growth. this condition is characterized by flattened bones of the spine (platyspondyly) and unusually short fingers and toes (brachydactyly), with the exception of the first (big) toes. other skeletal abnormalities associated with spondyloperipheral dysplasia include short stature, shortened long bones of the arms and legs, exaggerated curvature of the lower back (lordosis), and an inward- and upward-turning foot (clubfoot). additionally, some affected individuals have nearsightedness (myopia), hearing loss, and intellectual disability."
how many people are affected by spondyloperipheral dysplasia ?,this condition is rare; only a few affected individuals have been reported worldwide.
"what is (are) intrauterine growth restriction, metaphyseal dysplasia, adrenal hypoplasia congenita, and genital anomalies ?","the combination of intrauterine growth restriction, metaphyseal dysplasia, adrenal hypoplasia congenita, and genital anomalies is commonly known by the acronym image. this rare syndrome has signs and symptoms that affect many parts of the body. most affected individuals grow slowly before birth (intrauterine growth restriction) and are small in infancy. they have skeletal abnormalities that often become apparent in early childhood, although these abnormalities are usually mild and can be difficult to recognize on x-rays. the most common bone changes are metaphyseal dysplasia and epiphyseal dysplasia; these are malformations of the ends of long bones in the arms and legs. some affected individuals also have an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis) or thinning of the bones (osteoporosis). adrenal hypoplasia congenita is the most severe feature of image syndrome. the adrenal glands are a pair of small glands on top of each kidney. they produce a variety of hormones that regulate many essential functions in the body. underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of these glands prevents them from producing enough hormones, a condition known as adrenal insufficiency. the signs of adrenal insufficiency begin shortly after birth and include vomiting, difficulty with feeding, dehydration, extremely low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), and shock. if untreated, these complications can be life-threatening. the genital abnormalities associated with image syndrome occur only in affected males. they include an unusually small penis (micropenis), undescended testes (cryptorchidism), and the opening of the urethra on the underside of the penis (hypospadias). several additional signs and symptoms have been reported in people with image syndrome. some affected individuals have distinctive facial features, such as a prominent forehead, low-set ears, and a short nose with a flat nasal bridge. less commonly, people with this condition have premature fusion of certain bones of the skull (craniosynostosis), a split in the soft flap of tissue that hangs from the back of the mouth (cleft or bifid uvula), a high-arched roof of the mouth (palate), and a small chin (micrognathia). other possible features of image syndrome include high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia) or urine (hypercalcuria) and a shortage of growth hormone in childhood that results in short stature."
what is (are) spondyloenchondrodysplasia with immune dysregulation ?,"spondyloenchondrodysplasia with immune dysregulation (spencdi) is an inherited condition that primarily affects bone growth and immune system function. the signs and symptoms of spencdi can become apparent anytime from infancy to adolescence. bone abnormalities in individuals with spencdi include flattened spinal bones (platyspondyly), abnormalities at the ends of long bones in the limbs (metaphyseal dysplasia), and areas of damage (lesions) on the long bones and spinal bones that can be seen on x-rays. additional skeletal problems occur because of abnormalities of the tough, flexible tissue called cartilage that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. individuals with spencdi often have areas where cartilage did not convert to bone. they may also have noncancerous growths of cartilage (enchondromas). the bone and cartilage problems contribute to short stature in people with spencdi. individuals with spencdi have a combination of immune system problems. many affected individuals have malfunctioning immune systems that attack the body's own tissues and organs, which is known as an autoimmune reaction. the malfunctioning immune system can lead to a variety of disorders, such as a decrease in blood cells called platelets (thrombocytopenia), premature destruction of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia), an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), or chronic inflammatory disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. in addition, affected individuals often have abnormal immune cells that cannot grow and divide in response to harmful invaders such as bacteria and viruses. as a result of this immune deficiency, these individuals have frequent fevers and recurrent respiratory infections. some people with spencdi have neurological problems such as abnormal muscle stiffness (spasticity), difficulty with coordinating movements (ataxia), and intellectual disability. they may also have abnormal deposits of calcium (calcification) in the brain. due to the range of immune system problems, people with spencdi typically have a shortened life expectancy, but figures vary widely."
what is (are) erythrokeratodermia variabilis et progressiva ?,"erythrokeratodermia variabilis et progressiva (ekvp) is a skin disorder that is present at birth or becomes apparent in infancy. although its signs and symptoms vary, the condition is characterized by two major features. the first is areas of hyperkeratosis, which is rough, thickened skin. these thickened patches are usually reddish-brown and can either be widespread over many parts of the body or occur only in a small area. they tend to be fixed, meaning they do not spread or go away. however, the patches can vary in size and shape, and in some affected people they get larger over time. the areas of thickened skin are generally symmetric, which means they occur in the same places on the right and left sides of the body. the second major feature of ekvp is patches of reddened skin called erythematous areas. unlike the hyperkeratosis that occurs in this disorder, the erythematous areas are usually transient, which means they come and go. they vary in size, shape, and location, and can occur anywhere on the body. the redness can be triggered by sudden changes in temperature, emotional stress, or trauma or irritation to the area. it usually fades within hours to days."
is erythrokeratodermia variabilis et progressiva inherited ?,"ekvp is most often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. other cases result from new gene mutations and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. a few studies have suggested that ekvp can also have an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. however, this inheritance pattern has only been reported in a small number of affected families, and not all researchers agree that it is truly autosomal recessive. autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of a gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
is moebius syndrome inherited ?,"most cases of moebius syndrome are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. a small percentage of all cases have been reported to run in families; however, the condition does not have a single clear pattern of inheritance."
how many people are affected by laron syndrome ?,laron syndrome is a rare disorder. about 350 people have been diagnosed with the condition worldwide. the largest single group of affected individuals (about 100 people) lives in an area of southern ecuador.
is campomelic dysplasia inherited ?,"campomelic dysplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. most cases result from new mutations in or near the sox9 gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. rarely, affected individuals inherit a chromosome abnormality from a parent who may or may not show mild signs and symptoms of campomelic dysplasia."
is wiskott-aldrich syndrome inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an x-linked pattern. the gene associated with this condition is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell may or may not cause the disorder. in males (who have only one x chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder. in most cases of x-linked inheritance, males experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons."

what is (are) pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy ?,"pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy is a condition that involves seizures beginning in infancy or, in some cases, before birth. those affected typically experience prolonged seizures lasting several minutes (status epilepticus). these seizures involve muscle rigidity, convulsions, and loss of consciousness (tonic-clonic seizures). additional features of pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy include low body temperature (hypothermia), poor muscle tone (dystonia) soon after birth, and irritability before a seizure episode. in rare instances, children with this condition do not have seizures until they are 1 to 3 years old. anticonvulsant drugs, which are usually given to control seizures, are ineffective in people with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy. instead, people with this type of seizure are medically treated with large daily doses of pyridoxine (a type of vitamin b6 found in food). if left untreated, people with this condition can develop severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy). even though seizures can be controlled with pyridoxine, neurological problems such as developmental delay and learning disorders may still occur."
what are the genetic changes related to pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy ?,"mutations in the aldh7a1 gene cause pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy. the aldh7a1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called -aminoadipic semialdehyde (-aasa) dehydrogenase, also known as antiquitin. this enzyme is involved in the breakdown of the protein building block (amino acid) lysine in the brain. when antiquitin is deficient, a molecule that interferes with vitamin b6 function builds up in various tissues. pyridoxine plays a role in many processes in the body, such as the breakdown of amino acids and the productions of chemicals that transmit signals in the brain (neurotransmitters). it is unclear how a lack of pyridoxine causes the seizures that are characteristic of this condition. some individuals with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy do not have identified mutations in the aldh7a1 gene. in these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown."
what is (are) glutaric acidemia type i ?,"glutaric acidemia type i is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to process certain proteins properly. people with this disorder have inadequate levels of an enzyme that helps break down the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan, which are building blocks of protein. excessive levels of these amino acids and their intermediate breakdown products can accumulate and cause damage to the brain, particularly the basal ganglia, which are regions that help control movement. intellectual disability may also occur. the severity of glutaric acidemia type i varies widely; some individuals are only mildly affected, while others have severe problems. in most cases, signs and symptoms first occur in infancy or early childhood, but in a small number of affected individuals, the disorder first becomes apparent in adolescence or adulthood. some babies with glutaric acidemia type i are born with unusually large heads (macrocephaly). affected individuals may have difficulty moving and may experience spasms, jerking, rigidity, or decreased muscle tone. some individuals with glutaric acidemia have developed bleeding in the brain or eyes that could be mistaken for the effects of child abuse. strict dietary control may help limit progression of the neurological damage. stress caused by infection, fever or other demands on the body may lead to worsening of the signs and symptoms, with only partial recovery."

what are the genetic changes related to x-linked juvenile retinoschisis ?,"mutations in the rs1 gene cause most cases of x-linked juvenile retinoschisis. the rs1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called retinoschisin, which is found in the retina. studies suggest that retinoschisin plays a role in the development and maintenance of the retina. the protein is probably involved in the organization of cells in the retina by attaching cells together (cell adhesion). rs1 gene mutations result in a decrease in or complete loss of functional retinoschisin, which disrupts the maintenance and organization of cells in the retina. as a result, tiny splits (schisis) or tears form in the retina. this damage often forms a ""spoke-wheel"" pattern in the macula, which can be seen during an eye examination. in half of affected individuals, these abnormalities can occur in the area of the macula, affecting visual acuity, in the other half of cases the schisis occurs in the sides of the retina, resulting in impaired peripheral vision. some individuals with x-linked juvenile retinoschisis do not have a mutation in the rs1 gene. in these individuals, the cause of the disorder is unknown."
what is (are) spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita ?,"spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita is an inherited bone growth disorder that results in short stature (dwarfism), skeletal abnormalities, and problems with vision and hearing. this condition affects the bones of the spine (spondylo-) and the ends (epiphyses) of long bones in the arms and legs. congenita indicates that the condition is present from birth. people with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita have short stature from birth, with a very short trunk and neck and shortened limbs. their hands and feet, however, are usually average-sized. adult height ranges from 3 feet to just over 4 feet. abnormal curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis and lordosis) becomes more severe during childhood. instability of the spinal bones (vertebrae) in the neck may increase the risk of spinal cord damage. other skeletal features include flattened vertebrae (platyspondyly); an abnormality of the hip joint that causes the upper leg bones to turn inward (coxa vara); a foot deformity called a clubfoot; and a broad, barrel-shaped chest. abnormal development of the chest can cause problems with breathing. arthritis and decreased joint mobility often develop early in life. people with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita have mild changes in their facial features. the cheekbones close to the nose may appear flattened. some infants are born with an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate). severe nearsightedness (high myopia) is common, as are other eye problems that can impair vision. about one quarter of people with this condition have hearing loss."

what is (are) gorlin syndrome ?,"gorlin syndrome, also known as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, is a condition that affects many areas of the body and increases the risk of developing various cancerous and noncancerous tumors. in people with gorlin syndrome, the type of cancer diagnosed most often is basal cell carcinoma, which is the most common form of skin cancer. individuals with gorlin syndrome typically begin to develop basal cell carcinomas during adolescence or early adulthood. these cancers occur most often on the face, chest, and back. the number of basal cell carcinomas that develop during a person's lifetime varies among affected individuals. some people with gorlin syndrome never develop any basal cell carcinomas, while others may develop thousands of these cancers. individuals with lighter skin are more likely to develop basal cell carcinomas than are people with darker skin. most people with gorlin syndrome also develop noncancerous (benign) tumors of the jaw, called keratocystic odontogenic tumors. these tumors usually first appear during adolescence, and new tumors form until about age 30. keratocystic odontogenic tumors rarely develop later in adulthood. if untreated, these tumors may cause painful facial swelling and tooth displacement. individuals with gorlin syndrome have a higher risk than the general population of developing other tumors. a small proportion of affected individuals develop a brain tumor called medulloblastoma during childhood. a type of benign tumor called a fibroma can occur in the heart or in a woman's ovaries. heart (cardiac) fibromas often do not cause any symptoms, but they may obstruct blood flow or cause irregular heartbeats (arrhythmia). ovarian fibromas are not thought to affect a woman's ability to have children (fertility). other features of gorlin syndrome include small depressions (pits) in the skin of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet; an unusually large head size (macrocephaly) with a prominent forehead; and skeletal abnormalities involving the spine, ribs, or skull. these signs and symptoms are typically apparent from birth or become evident in early childhood."
how many people are affected by gorlin syndrome ?,"gorlin syndrome affects an estimated 1 in 31,000 people. while more than 1 million new cases of basal cell carcinoma are diagnosed each year in the united states, fewer than 1 percent of these skin cancers are related to gorlin syndrome."
what is (are) pdgfra-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia ?,"pdgfra-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia is a form of blood cell cancer characterized by an elevated number of cells called eosinophils in the blood. these cells help fight infections by certain parasites and are involved in the inflammation associated with allergic reactions. however, these circumstances do not account for the increased number of eosinophils in pdgfra-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia. another characteristic feature of pdgfra-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia is organ damage caused by the excess eosinophils. eosinophils release substances to aid in the immune response, but the release of excessive amounts of these substances causes damage to one or more organs, most commonly the heart, skin, lungs, or nervous system. eosinophil-associated organ damage can lead to a heart condition known as eosinophilic endomyocardial disease, skin rashes, coughing, difficulty breathing, swelling (edema) in the lower limbs, confusion, changes in behavior, or impaired movement or sensations. people with pdgfra-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia can also have an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) and elevated levels of certain chemicals called vitamin b12 and tryptase in the blood. some people with pdgfra-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia have an increased number of other types of white blood cells, such as neutrophils or mast cells. occasionally, people with pdgfra-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia develop other blood cell cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia or b-cell or t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma. pdgfra-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia is often grouped with a related condition called hypereosinophilic syndrome. these two conditions have very similar signs and symptoms; however, the cause of hypereosinophilic syndrome is unknown."
how many people are affected by freeman-sheldon syndrome ?,freeman-sheldon syndrome is a rare disorder; its exact prevalence is unknown.
what is (are) cystinuria ?,"cystinuria is a condition characterized by the buildup of the amino acid cystine, a building block of most proteins, in the kidneys and bladder. as the kidneys filter blood to create urine, cystine is normally absorbed back into the bloodstream. people with cystinuria cannot properly reabsorb cystine into their bloodstream, so the amino acid accumulates in their urine. as urine becomes more concentrated in the kidneys, the excess cystine forms crystals. larger crystals become stones that may lodge in the kidneys or in the bladder. sometimes cystine crystals combine with calcium molecules in the kidneys to form large stones. these crystals and stones can create blockages in the urinary tract and reduce the ability of the kidneys to eliminate waste through urine. the stones also provide sites where bacteria may cause infections."
how many people are affected by myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy ?,the prevalence of this condition is unknown.
what are the genetic changes related to myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy ?,"mutations in the mstn gene cause myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy. the mstn gene provides instructions for making a protein called myostatin, which is active in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles) both before and after birth. this protein normally restrains muscle growth, ensuring that muscles do not grow too large. mutations that reduce the production of functional myostatin lead to an overgrowth of muscle tissue."
what is (are) small fiber neuropathy ?,"small fiber neuropathy is a condition characterized by severe pain attacks that typically begin in the feet or hands. as a person ages, the pain attacks can affect other regions. some people initially experience a more generalized, whole-body pain. the attacks usually consist of pain described as stabbing or burning, or abnormal skin sensations such as tingling or itchiness. in some individuals, the pain is more severe during times of rest or at night. the signs and symptoms of small fiber neuropathy usually begin in adolescence to mid-adulthood. individuals with small fiber neuropathy cannot feel pain that is concentrated in a very small area, such as the prick of a pin. however, they have an increased sensitivity to pain in general (hyperalgesia) and experience pain from stimulation that typically does not cause pain (hypoesthesia). people affected with this condition may also have a reduced ability to differentiate between hot and cold. however, in some individuals, the pain attacks are provoked by cold or warm triggers. some affected individuals have urinary or bowel problems, episodes of rapid heartbeat (palpitations), dry eyes or mouth, or abnormal sweating. they can also experience a sharp drop in blood pressure upon standing (orthostatic hypotension), which can cause dizziness, blurred vision, or fainting. small fiber neuropathy is considered a form of peripheral neuropathy because it affects the peripheral nervous system, which connects the brain and spinal cord to muscles and to cells that detect sensations such as touch, smell, and pain."
is lynch syndrome inherited ?,"lynch syndrome cancer risk is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one inherited copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase cancer risk. it is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop cancer."

what is (are) hereditary fructose intolerance ?,"hereditary fructose intolerance is a condition that affects a person's ability to digest the sugar fructose. fructose is a simple sugar found primarily in fruits. affected individuals develop signs and symptoms of the disorder in infancy when fruits, juices, or other foods containing fructose are introduced into the diet. after ingesting fructose, individuals with hereditary fructose intolerance may experience nausea, bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). affected infants may fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). repeated ingestion of fructose-containing foods can lead to liver and kidney damage. the liver damage can result in a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), and chronic liver disease (cirrhosis). continued exposure to fructose may result in seizures, coma, and ultimately death from liver and kidney failure. due to the severity of symptoms experienced when fructose is ingested, most people with hereditary fructose intolerance develop a dislike for fruits, juices, and other foods containing fructose. hereditary fructose intolerance should not be confused with a condition called fructose malabsorption. in people with fructose malabsorption, the cells of the intestine cannot absorb fructose normally, leading to bloating, diarrhea or constipation, flatulence, and stomach pain. fructose malabsorption is thought to affect approximately 40 percent of individuals in the western hemisphere; its cause is unknown."

what is (are) huntington disease-like syndrome ?,"as its name suggests, a huntington disease-like (hdl) syndrome is a condition that resembles huntington disease. researchers have described four hdl syndromes, designated huntington disease-like 1 (hdl1) through huntington disease-like 4 (hdl4). these progressive brain disorders are characterized by uncontrolled movements, emotional problems, and loss of thinking ability. hdl syndromes occur in people with the characteristic features of huntington disease who do not have a mutation in hd, the gene typically associated with that disorder. hdl1, hdl2, and hdl4 usually appear in early to mid-adulthood, although they can begin earlier in life. the first signs and symptoms of these conditions often include irritability, emotional problems, small involuntary movements, poor coordination, and trouble learning new information or making decisions. many affected people develop involuntary jerking or twitching movements known as chorea. as the disease progresses, these abnormal movements become more pronounced. affected individuals may develop problems with walking, speaking, and swallowing. people with these disorders also experience changes in personality and a decline in thinking and reasoning abilities. individuals with an hdl syndrome can live for a few years to more than a decade after signs and symptoms begin. hdl3 begins much earlier in life than most of the other hdl syndromes (usually around age 3 or 4). affected children experience a decline in thinking ability, difficulties with movement and speech, and seizures. because hdl3 has a somewhat different pattern of signs and symptoms and a different pattern of inheritance, researchers are unsure whether it belongs in the same category as the other hdl syndromes."
how many people are affected by huntington disease-like syndrome ?,"overall, hdl syndromes are rare. they are much less common than huntington disease, which affects an estimated 3 to 7 per 100,000 people of european ancestry. of the four described hdl syndromes, hdl4 appears to be the most common. hdl2 is the second most common and occurs almost exclusively in people of african heritage (especially black south africans). hdl1 has been reported in only one family. hdl3 has been found in two families, both of which were from saudi arabia."
is holt-oram syndrome inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder."
what are the genetic changes related to glycogen storage disease type ix ?,"mutations in the phka1, phka2, phkb, or phkg2 genes are known to cause gsd ix. these genes provide instructions for making pieces (subunits) of an enzyme called phosphorylase b kinase. the enzyme is made up of 16 subunits, four each of the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta subunits. at least two different versions of phosphorylase b kinase are formed from the subunits: one is most abundant in liver cells and the other in muscle cells. the phka1 and phka2 genes provide instructions for making alpha subunits of phosphorylase b kinase. the protein produced from the phka1 gene is a subunit of the muscle enzyme, while the protein produced from the phka2 gene is part of the liver enzyme. the phkb gene provides instructions for making the beta subunit, which is found in both the muscle and the liver. the phkg2 gene provides instructions for making the gamma subunit of the liver enzyme. whether in the liver or the muscles, phosphorylase b kinase plays an important role in providing energy for cells. the main source of cellular energy is a simple sugar called glucose. glucose is stored in muscle and liver cells in a form called glycogen. glycogen can be broken down rapidly when glucose is needed, for instance to maintain normal levels of glucose in the blood between meals or for energy during exercise. phosphorylase b kinase turns on (activates) the enzyme that breaks down glycogen. although the effects of gene mutations on the respective protein subunits are unknown, mutations in the phka1, phka2, phkb, and phkg2 genes reduce the activity of phosphorylase b kinase in liver or muscle cells and in blood cells. reduction of this enzyme's function impairs glycogen breakdown. as a result, glycogen accumulates in and damages cells, and glucose is not available for energy. glycogen accumulation in the liver leads to hepatomegaly, and the liver's inability to break down glycogen for glucose contributes to hypoglycemia and ketosis. reduced energy production in muscle cells leads to muscle weakness, pain, and cramping."

what is (are) branchiootorenal/branchiootic syndrome ?,"branchiootorenal (bor) syndrome is a condition that disrupts the development of tissues in the neck and causes malformations of the ears and kidneys. the signs and symptoms of this condition vary widely, even among members of the same family. branchiootic (bo) syndrome includes many of the same features as bor syndrome, but affected individuals do not have kidney abnormalities. the two conditions are otherwise so similar that researchers often consider them together (bor/bo syndrome or branchiootorenal spectrum disorders). ""branchio-"" refers to the second branchial arch, which is a structure in the developing embryo that gives rise to tissues in the front and side of the neck. in people with bor/bo syndrome, abnormal development of the second branchial arch can result in the formation of masses in the neck called branchial cleft cysts. some affected people have abnormal holes or pits called fistulae in the side of the neck just above the collarbone. fistulae can form tunnels into the neck, exiting in the mouth near the tonsil. branchial cleft cysts and fistulae can cause health problems if they become infected, so they are often removed surgically. ""oto-"" and ""-otic"" refer to the ear; most people with bor/bo syndrome have hearing loss and other ear abnormalities. the hearing loss can be sensorineural, meaning it is caused by abnormalities in the inner ear; conductive, meaning it results from changes in the small bones in the middle ear; or mixed, meaning it is caused by a combination of inner ear and middle ear abnormalities. some affected people have tiny holes in the skin or extra bits of tissue just in front of the ear. these are called preauricular pits and preauricular tags, respectively. ""renal"" refers to the kidneys; bor syndrome (but not bo syndrome) causes abnormalities of kidney structure and function. these abnormalities range from mild to severe and can affect one or both kidneys. in some cases, end-stage renal disease (esrd) develops later in life. this serious condition occurs when the kidneys become unable to filter fluids and waste products from the body effectively."
is cleidocranial dysplasia inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. other cases may result from new mutations in the gene. these cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family."
what is (are) weill-marchesani syndrome ?,"weill-marchesani syndrome is a disorder of connective tissue. connective tissue forms the body's supportive framework, providing structure and strength to the muscles, joints, organs, and skin. the major signs and symptoms of weill-marchesani syndrome include short stature, eye abnormalities, unusually short fingers and toes (brachydactyly), and joint stiffness. adult height for men with weill-marchesani syndrome ranges from 4 feet, 8 inches to 5 feet, 6 inches. adult height for women with this condition ranges from 4 feet, 3 inches to 5 feet, 2 inches. an eye abnormality called microspherophakia is characteristic of weill-marchesani syndrome. this term refers to a small, sphere-shaped lens, which is associated with nearsightedness (myopia) that worsens over time. the lens also may be positioned abnormally within the eye (ectopia lentis). many people with weill-marchesani syndrome develop glaucoma, an eye disease that increases the pressure in the eye and can lead to blindness. occasionally, heart defects or an abnormal heart rhythm can occur in people with weill-marchesani syndrome."
is weill-marchesani syndrome inherited ?,"weill-marchesani syndrome can be inherited in either an autosomal recessive or an autosomal dominant pattern. when weill-marchesani syndrome is caused by mutations in the adamts10 gene, it has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. other cases of weill-marchesani syndrome, including those caused by mutations in the fbn1 gene, have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in most cases, an affected person inherits the genetic change from one parent with the condition."
what is (are) familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification ?,"familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (fibgc, formerly known as fahr disease) is a condition characterized by abnormal deposits of calcium (calcification) in the brain. these calcium deposits typically occur in the basal ganglia, which are structures deep within the brain that help start and control movement; however, other brain regions can also be affected. the signs and symptoms of fibgc include movement disorders and psychiatric or behavioral difficulties. these problems begin in adulthood, usually in a person's thirties. the movement difficulties experienced by people with fibgc include involuntary tensing of various muscles (dystonia), problems coordinating movements (ataxia), and uncontrollable movements of the limbs (choreoathetosis). affected individuals often have seizures as well. the psychiatric and behavioral problems include difficulty concentrating, memory loss, changes in personality, a distorted view of reality (psychosis), and decline in intellectual function (dementia). an estimated 20 to 30 percent of people with fibgc have one of these psychiatric disorders. the severity of this condition varies among affected individuals; some people have no symptoms related to the brain calcification, whereas other people have significant movement and psychiatric problems."
what are the genetic changes related to monilethrix ?,"monilethrix is caused by mutations in one of several genes. mutations in the krt81 gene, the krt83 gene, the krt86 gene, or the dsg4 gene account for most cases of monilethrix. these genes provide instructions for making proteins that give structure and strength to strands of hair. hair growth occurs in the hair follicle, a specialized structure in the skin. as the cells of the hair follicle mature to take on specialized functions (differentiate), they produce particular proteins and form the different compartments of the hair follicle and the hair shaft. as the cells in the hair follicle divide, the hair shaft is pushed upward and extends beyond the skin. the krt81, krt83, and krt86 genes provide instructions for making proteins known as keratins. keratins are a group of tough, fibrous proteins that form the structural framework of cells that make up the hair, skin, and nails. the krt81 gene provides instructions for making the type ii hair keratin k81 protein (k81); the krt83 gene provides instruction for making the type ii hair keratin k83 protein (k83); and the krt86 gene provides instructions for making the type ii hair keratin k86 protein (k86). the k81, k83, and k86 proteins are found in cells of the inner compartment of the hair shaft known as the cortex. these proteins give hair its strength and elasticity. the dsg4 gene provides instructions for making a protein called desmoglein 4 (dsg4). this protein is found in specialized structures called desmosomes that are located in the membrane surrounding certain cells. these structures help attach cells to one another and play a role in communication between cells. the dsg4 protein is found in particular regions of the hair follicle, including the hair shaft cortex. desmosomes in these regions provide strength to the hair and are thought to play a role in communicating the signals for cells to differentiate to form the hair shaft. in people with monilethrix, the cortex of the affected hair shaft appears abnormal. however, it is unclear how mutations in the krt81, krt83, krt86, or dsg4 genes are related to the abnormality in the cortex or the beaded appearance of the hair. some people with monilethrix do not have a mutation in one of these genes. these individuals may have a genetic change in another gene, or the cause of the condition may be unknown."
what is (are) spastic paraplegia type 7 ?,"spastic paraplegia type 7 is part of a group of genetic disorders known as hereditary spastic paraplegias. these disorders are characterized by progressive muscle stiffness (spasticity) and the development of paralysis of the lower limbs (paraplegia). hereditary spastic paraplegias are divided into two types: pure and complex. the pure types involve the lower limbs. the complex types involve the lower limbs and can also affect the upper limbs to a lesser degree; the structure or functioning of the brain; and the nerves connecting the brain and spinal cord to muscles and sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch, pain, heat, and sound (the peripheral nervous system). spastic paraplegia type 7 can occur in either the pure or complex form. like all hereditary spastic paraplegias, spastic paraplegia type 7 involves spasticity of the leg muscles and increased muscle weakness. people with this form of spastic paraplegia can also experience exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia) in the arms; speech difficulties (dysarthria); difficulty swallowing (dysphagia); involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus); mild hearing loss; abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis); high-arched feet (pes cavus); numbness, tingling, or pain in the arms and legs (sensory neuropathy); disturbance in the nerves used for muscle movement (motor neuropathy); and muscle wasting (amyotrophy). the onset of symptoms varies greatly among those with spastic paraplegia type 7; however, abnormalities in muscle tone and other features are usually noticeable in adulthood."
what is (are) hajdu-cheney syndrome ?,"hajdu-cheney syndrome is a rare disorder that can affect many parts of the body, particularly the bones. loss of bone tissue from the hands and feet (acro-osteolysis) is a characteristic feature of the condition. the fingers and toes are short and broad, and they may become shorter over time as bone at the tips continues to break down. bone loss in the fingers can interfere with fine motor skills, such as picking up small objects. bone abnormalities throughout the body are common in hajdu-cheney syndrome. affected individuals develop osteoporosis, which causes the bones to be brittle and prone to fracture. many affected individuals experience breakage (compression fractures) of the spinal bones (vertebrae). some also develop abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis or kyphosis). hajdu-cheney syndrome also affects the shape and strength of the long bones in the arms and legs. the abnormalities associated with this condition lead to short stature. hajdu-cheney syndrome also causes abnormalities of the skull bones, including the bones of the face. the shape of the skull is often described as dolichocephalic, which means it is elongated from back to front. in many affected individuals, the bone at the back of the skull bulges outward, causing a bump called a prominent occiput. distinctive facial features associated with this condition include widely spaced and downward-slanting eyes, eyebrows that grow together in the middle (synophrys), low-set ears, a sunken appearance of the middle of the face (midface hypoplasia), and a large space between the nose and upper lip (a long philtrum). some affected children are born with an opening in the roof of the mouth called a cleft palate or with a high arched palate. in affected adults, the facial features are often described as ""coarse."" other features of hajdu-cheney syndrome found in some affected individuals include joint abnormalities, particularly an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility); dental problems; hearing loss; a deep, gravelly voice; excess body hair; recurrent infections in childhood; heart defects; and kidney abnormalities such as the growth of multiple fluid-filled cysts (polycystic kidneys). some people with this condition have delayed development in childhood, but the delays are usually mild. the most serious complications of hajdu-cheney syndrome, which occur in about half of all affected individuals, are abnormalities known as platybasia and basilar invagination. platybasia is a flattening of the base of the skull caused by thinning and softening of the skull bones. basilar invagination occurs when the softened bones allow part of the spine to protrude abnormally through the opening at the bottom of the skull, pushing into the lower parts of the brain. these abnormalities can lead to severe neurological problems, including headaches, abnormal vision and balance, a buildup of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus), abnormal breathing, and sudden death. the signs and symptoms of hajdu-cheney syndrome vary greatly among affected individuals, even among members of the same family. many of the disorder's features, such as acro-osteolysis and some of the characteristic facial features, are not present at birth but become apparent in childhood or later. the risk of developing platybasia and basilar invagination also increases over time. the features of hajdu-cheney syndrome overlap significantly with those of a condition called serpentine fibula-polycystic kidney syndrome (sfpks). although they used to be considered separate disorders, researchers discovered that the two conditions are associated with mutations in the same gene. based on these similarities, many researchers now consider hajdu-cheney syndrome and sfpks to be variants of the same condition."
what are the genetic changes related to cerebral cavernous malformation ?,"mutations in at least three genes, krit1 (also known as ccm1), ccm2, and pdcd10 (also known as ccm3), cause familial cerebral cavernous malformations. the precise functions of these genes are not fully understood. studies show that the proteins produced from these genes are found in the junctions connecting neighboring blood vessel cells. the proteins interact with each other as part of a complex that strengthens the interactions between cells and limits leakage from the blood vessels. mutations in any of the three genes impair the function of the protein complex, resulting in weakened cell-to-cell junctions and increased leakage from vessels as seen in cerebral cavernous malformations. mutations in these three genes account for 85 to 95 percent of all cases of familial cerebral cavernous malformations. the remaining 5 to 15 percent of cases may be due to mutations in unidentified genes or to other unknown causes. mutations in the krit1, ccm2, and pdcd10 genes are not involved in sporadic cerebral cavernous malformations. the cause of this form of the condition is unknown."

what are the genetic changes related to larsen syndrome ?,"mutations in the flnb gene cause larsen syndrome. the flnb gene provides instructions for making a protein called filamin b. this protein helps build the network of protein filaments (cytoskeleton) that gives structure to cells and allows them to change shape and move. filamin b attaches (binds) to another protein called actin and helps the actin to form the branching network of filaments that makes up the cytoskeleton. it also links actin to many other proteins to perform various functions within the cell, including the cell signaling that helps determine how the cytoskeleton will change as tissues grow and take shape during development. filamin b is especially important in the development of the skeleton before birth. it is active (expressed) in the cell membranes of cartilage-forming cells (chondrocytes). cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. most cartilage is later converted to bone (a process called ossification), except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose, airways (trachea and bronchi), and external ears. filamin b appears to be important for normal cell growth and division (proliferation) and maturation (differentiation) of chondrocytes and for the ossification of cartilage. flnb gene mutations that cause larsen syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the filamin b protein or delete a small section of the protein sequence, resulting in an abnormal protein. this abnormal protein appears to have a new, atypical function that interferes with the proliferation or differentiation of chondrocytes, impairing ossification and leading to the signs and symptoms of larsen syndrome."

what are the genetic changes related to bietti crystalline dystrophy ?,"bietti crystalline dystrophy is caused by mutations in the cyp4v2 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a member of the cytochrome p450 family of enzymes. these enzymes are involved in the formation and breakdown of various molecules and chemicals within cells. the cyp4v2 enzyme is involved in a multi-step process called fatty acid oxidation in which lipids are broken down and converted into energy, but the enzyme's specific function is not well understood. cyp4v2 gene mutations that cause bietti crystalline dystrophy impair or eliminate the function of this enzyme and are believed to affect lipid breakdown. however, it is unknown how they lead to the specific signs and symptoms of bietti crystalline dystrophy. for unknown reasons, the severity of the signs and symptoms differs significantly among individuals with the same cyp4v2 gene mutation."
is bietti crystalline dystrophy inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."

how many people are affected by cold-induced sweating syndrome ?,"cold-induced sweating syndrome is a rare condition; its prevalence is unknown. the condition was first identified in the sardinian population, but it has since been reported in regions worldwide."
is cold-induced sweating syndrome inherited ?,"cold-induced sweating syndrome is inherited in anautosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the crlf1 or clcf1 gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
is spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an x-linked pattern. a condition is considered x-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the x chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder. in most cases, males experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females (who have two x chromosomes). females with a mutation in one copy of the ar gene in each cell are typically unaffected. a few females with mutations in both copies of the gene have had mild features related to the condition, including muscle cramps and occasional tremors. researchers believe that the milder signs and symptoms in females may be related to lower androgen levels. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons."

what is (are) walker-warburg syndrome ?,"walker-warburg syndrome is an inherited disorder that affects development of the muscles, brain, and eyes. it is the most severe of a group of genetic conditions known as congenital muscular dystrophies, which cause muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy) beginning very early in life. the signs and symptoms of walker-warburg syndrome are present at birth or in early infancy. because of the severity of the problems caused by walker-warburg syndrome, most affected individuals do not survive past age 3. walker-warburg syndrome affects the skeletal muscles, which are muscles the body uses for movement. affected babies have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and are sometimes described as ""floppy."" the muscle weakness worsens over time. walker-warburg syndrome also affects the brain; individuals with this condition typically have a brain abnormality called cobblestone lissencephaly, in which the surface of the brain lacks the normal folds and grooves and instead develops a bumpy, irregular appearance (like that of cobblestones). they may also have a buildup of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus) or abnormalities of other parts of the brain, including a region called the cerebellum and the part of the brain that connects to the spinal cord (the brainstem). these changes in the structure of the brain lead to significantly delayed development and intellectual disability. some individuals with walker-warburg syndrome experience seizures. eye abnormalities are also characteristic of walker-warburg syndrome. these can include unusually small eyeballs (microphthalmia), enlarged eyeballs caused by increased pressure in the eyes (buphthalmos), clouding of the lenses of the eyes (cataracts), and problems with the nerve that relays visual information from the eyes to the brain (the optic nerve). these eye problems lead to vision impairment in affected individuals."
what is (are) glycogen storage disease type vi ?,glycogen storage disease type vi (also known as gsdvi or hers disease) is an inherited disorder caused by an inability to break down a complex sugar called glycogen in liver cells. a lack of glycogen breakdown interferes with the normal function of the liver. the signs and symptoms of gsdvi typically begin in infancy to early childhood. the first sign is usually an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly). affected individuals may also have low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) or a buildup of lactic acid in the body (lactic acidosis) during prolonged periods without food (fasting). the signs and symptoms of gsdvi tend to improve with age; most adults with this condition do not have any related health problems.
what are the genetic changes related to glycogen storage disease type vi ?,"mutations in the pygl gene cause gsdvi. the pygl gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called liver glycogen phosphorylase. this enzyme is found only in liver cells, where it breaks down glycogen into a type of sugar called glucose-1-phosphate. additional steps convert glucose-1-phosphate into glucose, a simple sugar that is the main energy source for most cells in the body. pygl gene mutations prevent liver glycogen phosphorylase from breaking down glycogen effectively. as a result, liver cells cannot use glycogen for energy. since glycogen cannot be broken down, it accumulates within liver cells, causing these cells to become enlarged and dysfunctional."
is guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
is osteogenesis imperfecta inherited ?,"most cases of osteogenesis imperfecta have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. many people with type i or type iv osteogenesis imperfecta inherit a mutation from a parent who has the disorder. most infants with more severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (such as type ii and type iii) have no history of the condition in their family. in these infants, the condition is caused by new (sporadic) mutations in the col1a1 or col1a2 gene. less commonly, osteogenesis imperfecta has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. autosomal recessive inheritance means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. the parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder typically are not affected, but each carry one copy of the altered gene. some cases of osteogenesis imperfecta type iii are autosomal recessive; these cases usually result from mutations in genes other than col1a1 and col1a2. when osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in the crtap or p3h1 gene, the condition also has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance."

how many people are affected by anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immune deficiency ?,"the prevalence of the x-linked recessive type of eda-id is estimated to be 1 in 250,000 individuals. only a few cases of the autosomal dominant form have been described in the scientific literature."
is anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immune deficiency inherited ?,"when eda-id is caused by mutations in the ikbkg gene, it is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. the ikbkg gene is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of the ikbkg gene, males are affected by x-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons. when eda-id is caused by mutations in the nfkbia gene, the condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. most cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family."
what is (are) hypophosphatasia ?,"hypophosphatasia is an inherited disorder that affects the development of bones and teeth. this condition disrupts a process called mineralization, in which minerals such as calcium and phosphorus are deposited in developing bones and teeth. mineralization is critical for the formation of bones that are strong and rigid and teeth that can withstand chewing and grinding. the signs and symptoms of hypophosphatasia vary widely and can appear anywhere from before birth to adulthood. the most severe forms of the disorder tend to occur before birth and in early infancy. hypophosphatasia weakens and softens the bones, causing skeletal abnormalities similar to another childhood bone disorder called rickets. affected infants are born with short limbs, an abnormally shaped chest, and soft skull bones. additional complications in infancy include poor feeding and a failure to gain weight, respiratory problems, and high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia), which can lead to recurrent vomiting and kidney problems. these complications are life-threatening in some cases. the forms of hypophosphatasia that appear in childhood or adulthood are typically less severe than those that appear in infancy. early loss of primary (baby) teeth is one of the first signs of the condition in children. affected children may have short stature with bowed legs or knock knees, enlarged wrist and ankle joints, and an abnormal skull shape. adult forms of hypophosphatasia are characterized by a softening of the bones known as osteomalacia. in adults, recurrent fractures in the foot and thigh bones can lead to chronic pain. affected adults may lose their secondary (adult) teeth prematurely and are at increased risk for joint pain and inflammation. the mildest form of this condition, called odontohypophosphatasia, only affects the teeth. people with this disorder typically experience abnormal tooth development and premature tooth loss, but do not have the skeletal abnormalities seen in other forms of hypophosphatasia."
what is (are) central core disease ?,"central core disease is a disorder that affects muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). this condition causes muscle weakness that ranges from almost unnoticeable to very severe. most people with central core disease experience persistent, mild muscle weakness that does not worsen with time. this weakness affects the muscles near the center of the body (proximal muscles), particularly muscles in the upper legs and hips. muscle weakness causes affected infants to appear ""floppy"" and can delay the development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking. in severe cases, affected infants experience profoundly weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and serious or life-threatening breathing problems. central core disease is also associated with skeletal abnormalities such as abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), hip dislocation, and joint deformities called contractures that restrict the movement of certain joints. many people with central core disease also have an increased risk of developing a severe reaction to certain drugs used during surgery and other invasive procedures. this reaction is called malignant hyperthermia. malignant hyperthermia occurs in response to some anesthetic gases, which are used to block the sensation of pain, and with a particular type of muscle relaxant. if given these drugs, people at risk for malignant hyperthermia may experience muscle rigidity, breakdown of muscle fibers (rhabdomyolysis), a high fever, increased acid levels in the blood and other tissues (acidosis), and a rapid heart rate. the complications of malignant hyperthermia can be life-threatening unless they are treated promptly. central core disease gets its name from disorganized areas called cores, which are found in the center of muscle fibers in many affected individuals. these abnormal regions can only be seen under a microscope. although the presence of cores can help doctors diagnose central core disease, it is unclear how they are related to muscle weakness and the other features of this condition."

how many people are affected by molybdenum cofactor deficiency ?,"molybdenum cofactor deficiency is a rare condition that is estimated to occur in 1 in 100,000 to 200,000 newborns worldwide. more than 100 cases have been reported in the medical literature, although it is thought that the condition is underdiagnosed, so the number of affected individuals may be higher."
what is (are) retinoblastoma ?,"retinoblastoma is a rare type of eye cancer that usually develops in early childhood, typically before the age of 5. this form of cancer develops in the retina, which is the specialized light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. in most children with retinoblastoma, the disease affects only one eye. however, one out of three children with retinoblastoma develops cancer in both eyes. the most common first sign of retinoblastoma is a visible whiteness in the pupil called ""cat's eye reflex"" or leukocoria. this unusual whiteness is particularly noticeable in photographs taken with a flash. other signs and symptoms of retinoblastoma include crossed eyes or eyes that do not point in the same direction (strabismus); persistent eye pain, redness, or irritation; and blindness or poor vision in the affected eye(s). retinoblastoma is often curable when it is diagnosed early. however, if it is not treated promptly, this cancer can spread beyond the eye to other parts of the body. this advanced form of retinoblastoma can be life-threatening. when retinoblastoma is associated with a gene mutation that occurs in all of the body's cells, it is known as germinal retinoblastoma. people with this form of retinoblastoma also have an increased risk of developing several other cancers outside the eye. specifically, they are more likely to develop a cancer of the pineal gland in the brain (pinealoma), a type of bone cancer known as osteosarcoma, cancers of soft tissues such as muscle, and an aggressive form of skin cancer called melanoma."
what are the genetic changes related to alexander disease ?,"mutations in the gfap gene cause alexander disease. the gfap gene provides instructions for making a protein called glial fibrillary acidic protein. several molecules of this protein bind together to form intermediate filaments, which provide support and strength to cells. mutations in the gfap gene lead to the production of a structurally altered glial fibrillary acidic protein. the altered protein is thought to impair the formation of normal intermediate filaments. as a result, the abnormal glial fibrillary acidic protein likely accumulates in astroglial cells, leading to the formation of rosenthal fibers, which impair cell function. it is not well understood how impaired astroglial cells contribute to the abnormal formation or maintenance of myelin, leading to the signs and symptoms of alexander disease."
what is (are) 9q22.3 microdeletion ?,"9q22.3 microdeletion is a chromosomal change in which a small piece of chromosome 9 is deleted in each cell. the deletion occurs on the long (q) arm of the chromosome in a region designated q22.3. this chromosomal change is associated with delayed development, intellectual disability, certain physical abnormalities, and the characteristic features of a genetic condition called gorlin syndrome. many individuals with a 9q22.3 microdeletion have delayed development, particularly affecting the development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking. in some people, the delays are temporary and improve in childhood. more severely affected individuals have permanent developmental disabilities along with intellectual impairment and learning problems. rarely, seizures have been reported in people with a 9q22.3 microdeletion. about 20 percent of people with a 9q22.3 microdeletion experience overgrowth (macrosomia), which results in increased height and weight compared to unaffected peers. the macrosomia often begins before birth and continues into childhood. other physical changes that can be associated with a 9q22.3 microdeletion include the premature fusion of certain bones in the skull (metopic craniosynostosis) and a buildup of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus). affected individuals can also have distinctive facial features such as a prominent forehead with vertical skin creases, upward- or downward-slanting eyes, a short nose, and a long space between the nose and upper lip (philtrum). 9q22.3 microdeletions also cause the characteristic features of gorlin syndrome (also known as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome). this genetic condition affects many areas of the body and increases the risk of developing various cancerous and noncancerous tumors. in people with gorlin syndrome, the type of cancer diagnosed most often is basal cell carcinoma, which is the most common form of skin cancer. most people with this condition also develop noncancerous (benign) tumors of the jaw, called keratocystic odontogenic tumors, which can cause facial swelling and tooth displacement. other types of tumors that occur more often in people with gorlin syndrome include a form of childhood brain cancer called a medulloblastoma and a type of benign tumor called a fibroma that occurs in the heart or in a woman's ovaries. other features of gorlin syndrome include small depressions (pits) in the skin of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet; an unusually large head size (macrocephaly) with a prominent forehead; and skeletal abnormalities involving the spine, ribs, or skull."
what is (are) darier disease ?,"darier disease is a skin condition characterized by wart-like blemishes on the body. the blemishes are usually yellowish in color, hard to the touch, mildly greasy, and can emit a strong odor. the most common sites for blemishes are the scalp, forehead, upper arms, chest, back, knees, elbows, and behind the ear. the mucous membranes can also be affected, with blemishes on the roof of the mouth (palate), tongue, inside of the cheek, gums, and throat. other features of darier disease include nail abnormalities, such as red and white streaks in the nails with an irregular texture, and small pits in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. the wart-like blemishes characteristic of darier disease usually appear in late childhood to early adulthood. the severity of the disease varies over time; affected people experience flare-ups alternating with periods when they have fewer blemishes. the appearance of the blemishes is influenced by environmental factors. most people with darier disease will develop more blemishes during the summertime when they are exposed to heat and humidity. uv light; minor injury or friction, such as rubbing or scratching; and ingestion of certain medications can also cause an increase in blemishes. on occasion, people with darier disease may have neurological disorders such as mild intellectual disability, epilepsy, and depression. learning and behavior difficulties have also been reported in people with darier disease. researchers do not know if these conditions, which are common in the general population, are associated with the genetic changes that cause darier disease, or if they are coincidental. some researchers believe that behavioral problems might be linked to the social stigma experienced by people with numerous skin blemishes. a form of darier disease known as the linear or segmental form is characterized by blemishes on localized areas of the skin. the blemishes are not as widespread as they are in typical darier disease. some people with the linear form of this condition have the nail abnormalities that are seen in people with classic darier disease, but these abnormalities occur only on one side of the body."
is darier disease inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. other cases may result from new mutations in the gene. these cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. the linear form of darier disease is generally not inherited but arises from mutations in the body's cells that occur after conception. these alterations are called somatic mutations."
what is (are) d-bifunctional protein deficiency ?,"d-bifunctional protein deficiency is a disorder that causes deterioration of nervous system functions (neurodegeneration) beginning in infancy. newborns with d-bifunctional protein deficiency have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and seizures. most babies with this condition never acquire any developmental skills. some may reach very early developmental milestones such as the ability to follow movement with their eyes or control their head movement, but they experience a gradual loss of these skills (developmental regression) within a few months. as the condition gets worse, affected children develop exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia), increased muscle tone (hypertonia), more severe and recurrent seizures (epilepsy), and loss of vision and hearing. most children with d-bifunctional protein deficiency do not survive past the age of 2. a small number of individuals with this disorder are somewhat less severely affected. they may acquire additional basic skills, such as voluntary hand movements or unsupported sitting, before experiencing developmental regression, and they may survive longer into childhood than more severely affected individuals. individuals with d-bifunctional protein deficiency may have unusual facial features, including a high forehead, widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), a lengthened area between the nose and mouth (philtrum), and a high arch of the hard palate at the roof of the mouth. affected infants may also have an unusually large space between the bones of the skull (fontanel). an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly) occurs in about half of affected individuals. because these features are similar to those of another disorder called zellweger syndrome (part of a group of disorders called the zellweger spectrum), d-bifunctional protein deficiency is sometimes called pseudo-zellweger syndrome."
how many people are affected by combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria ?,cmamma appears to be a rare disease. approximately a dozen cases have been reported in the scientific literature.
what is (are) dicer1 syndrome ?,"dicer1 syndrome is an inherited disorder that increases the risk of a variety of cancerous and noncancerous (benign) tumors, most commonly certain types of tumors that occur in the lungs, kidneys, ovaries, and thyroid (a butterfly-shaped gland in the lower neck). affected individuals can develop one or more types of tumors, and members of the same family can have different types. however, the risk of tumor formation in individuals with dicer1 syndrome is only moderately increased compared with tumor risk in the general population; most individuals with genetic changes associated with this condition never develop tumors. people with dicer1 syndrome who develop tumors most commonly develop pleuropulmonary blastoma, which is characterized by tumors that grow in lung tissue or in the outer covering of the lungs (the pleura). these tumors occur in infants and young children and are rare in adults. pleuropulmonary blastoma is classified as one of three types on the basis of tumor characteristics: in type i, the growths are composed of air-filled pockets called cysts; in type ii, the growths contain both cysts and solid tumors (or nodules); and in type iii, the growth is a solid tumor that can fill a large portion of the chest. pleuropulmonary blastoma is considered cancerous, and types ii and iii can spread (metastasize), often to the brain, liver, or bones. individuals with pleuropulmonary blastoma may also develop an abnormal accumulation of air in the chest cavity that can lead to the collapse of a lung (pneumothorax). cystic nephroma, which involves multiple benign fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys, can also occur; in people with dicer1 syndrome, the cysts develop early in childhood. dicer1 syndrome is also associated with tumors in the ovaries known as sertoli-leydig cell tumors, which typically develop in affected women in their teens or twenties. some sertoli-leydig cell tumors release the male sex hormone testosterone; in these cases, affected women may develop facial hair, a deep voice, and other male characteristics. some affected women have irregular menstrual cycles. sertoli-leydig cell tumors usually do not metastasize. people with dicer1 syndrome are also at risk of multinodular goiter, which is enlargement of the thyroid gland caused by the growth of multiple fluid-filled or solid tumors (both referred to as nodules). the nodules are generally slow-growing and benign. despite the growths, the thyroid's function is often normal. rarely, individuals with dicer1 syndrome develop thyroid cancer (thyroid carcinoma)."

what is (are) rapadilino syndrome ?,"rapadilino syndrome is a rare condition that involves many parts of the body. bone development is especially affected, causing many of the characteristic features of the condition. most affected individuals have underdevelopment or absence of the bones in the forearms and the thumbs, which are known as radial ray malformations. the kneecaps (patellae) can also be underdeveloped or absent. other features include an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) or a high arched palate; a long, slender nose; and dislocated joints. many infants with rapadilino syndrome have difficulty feeding and experience diarrhea and vomiting. the combination of impaired bone development and feeding problems leads to slow growth and short stature in affected individuals. some individuals with rapadilino syndrome have harmless light brown patches of skin that resemble a skin finding known as caf-au-lait spots. in addition, people with rapadilino syndrome have a slightly increased risk of developing a type of bone cancer known as osteosarcoma or a blood-related cancer called lymphoma. in individuals with rapadilino syndrome, osteosarcoma most often develops during childhood or adolescence, and lymphoma typically develops in young adulthood. the condition name is an acronym for the characteristic features of the disorder: ra for radial ray malformations, pa for patella and palate abnormalities, di for diarrhea and dislocated joints, li for limb abnormalities and little size, and no for slender nose and normal intelligence. the varied signs and symptoms of rapadilino syndrome overlap with features of other disorders, namely baller-gerold syndrome and rothmund-thomson syndrome. these syndromes are also characterized by radial ray defects, skeletal abnormalities, and slow growth. all of these conditions can be caused by mutations in the same gene. based on these similarities, researchers are investigating whether baller-gerold syndrome, rothmund-thomson syndrome, and rapadilino syndrome are separate disorders or part of a single syndrome with overlapping signs and symptoms."

what is (are) familial mediterranean fever ?,"familial mediterranean fever is an inherited condition characterized by recurrent episodes of painful inflammation in the abdomen, chest, or joints. these episodes are often accompanied by fever and sometimes a rash or headache. occasionally inflammation may occur in other parts of the body, such as the heart; the membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord; and in males, the testicles. in about half of affected individuals, attacks are preceded by mild signs and symptoms known as a prodrome. prodromal symptoms include mildly uncomfortable sensations in the area that will later become inflamed, or more general feelings of discomfort. the first episode of illness in familial mediterranean fever usually occurs in childhood or the teenage years, but in some cases, the initial attack occurs much later in life. typically, episodes last 12 to 72 hours and can vary in severity. the length of time between attacks is also variable and can range from days to years. during these periods, affected individuals usually have no signs or symptoms related to the condition. however, without treatment to help prevent attacks and complications, a buildup of protein deposits (amyloidosis) in the body's organs and tissues may occur, especially in the kidneys, which can lead to kidney failure."
what are the genetic changes related to familial mediterranean fever ?,"mutations in the mefv gene cause familial mediterranean fever. the mefv gene provides instructions for making a protein called pyrin (also known as marenostrin), which is found in white blood cells. this protein is involved in the immune system, helping to regulate the process of inflammation. inflammation occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and facilitate tissue repair. when this process is complete, the body stops the inflammatory response to prevent damage to its own cells and tissues. mutations in the mefv gene reduce the activity of the pyrin protein, which disrupts control of the inflammation process. an inappropriate or prolonged inflammatory response can result, leading to fever and pain in the abdomen, chest, or joints. normal variations in the saa1 gene may modify the course of familial mediterranean fever. some evidence suggests that a particular version of the saa1 gene (called the alpha variant) increases the risk of amyloidosis among people with familial mediterranean fever."

what are the genetic changes related to myh9-related disorder ?,"myh9-related disorder is caused by mutations in the myh9 gene. the myh9 gene provides instructions for making a protein called myosin-9. this protein is one part (subunit) of the myosin iia protein. there are three forms of myosin ii, called myosin iia, myosin iib and myosin iic. the three forms are found throughout the body and perform similar functions. they play roles in cell movement (cell motility); maintenance of cell shape; and cytokinesis, which is the step in cell division when the fluid surrounding the nucleus (the cytoplasm) divides to form two separate cells. while some cells use more than one type of myosin ii, certain blood cells such as platelets and white blood cells (leukocytes) use only myosin iia. myh9 gene mutations that cause myh9-related disorder typically result in a nonfunctional version of the myosin-9 protein. the nonfunctional protein cannot properly interact with other subunits to form myosin iia. platelets and leukocytes, which only use myosin iia, are most affected by a lack of functional myosin-9. it is thought that a lack of functional myosin iia leads to the release of large, immature platelets in the bloodstream, resulting in a reduced amount of normal platelets. in leukocytes, the nonfunctional myosin-9 clumps together. these clumps of protein, called inclusion bodies, are a hallmark of myh9-related disorder and are present in the leukocytes of everyone with this condition."

what are the genetic changes related to prekallikrein deficiency ?,"prekallikrein deficiency is caused by mutations in the klkb1 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called prekallikrein. this protein, when converted to an active form called plasma kallikrein in the blood, is involved in the early stages of blood clotting. plasma kallikrein plays a role in a process called the intrinsic coagulation pathway (also called the contact activation pathway). this pathway turns on (activates) proteins that are needed later in the clotting process. blood clots protect the body after an injury by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss. the klkb1 gene mutations that cause prekallikrein deficiency reduce or eliminate functional plasma kallikrein, which likely impairs the intrinsic coagulation pathway. researchers suggest that this lack (deficiency) of functional plasma kallikrein protein does not generally cause any symptoms because another process called the extrinsic coagulation pathway (also known as the tissue factor pathway) can compensate for the impaired intrinsic coagulation pathway."
what is (are) fish-eye disease ?,"fish-eye disease, also called partial lcat deficiency, is a disorder that causes the clear front surface of the eyes (the corneas) to gradually become cloudy. the cloudiness, which generally first appears in adolescence or early adulthood, consists of small grayish dots of cholesterol (opacities) distributed across the corneas. cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is produced in the body and obtained from foods that come from animals; it aids in many functions of the body but can become harmful in excessive amounts. as fish-eye disease progresses, the corneal cloudiness worsens and can lead to severely impaired vision."
is fish-eye disease inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what is (are) megdel syndrome ?,"megdel syndrome is an inherited disorder that affects multiple body systems. it is named for several of its features: 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (meg), deafness (d), encephalopathy (e), and leigh-like disease (l). megdel syndrome is characterized by abnormally high levels of an acid, called 3-methylglutaconic acid, in the urine (3-methylglutaconic aciduria). megdel syndrome is one of a group of metabolic disorders that can be diagnosed by presence of this feature. people with megdel syndrome also have high urine levels of another acid called 3-methylglutaric acid. in infancy, individuals with megdel syndrome develop hearing loss caused by changes in the inner ear (sensorineural deafness); the hearing problems gradually worsen over time. another feature of megdel syndrome is brain dysfunction (encephalopathy). in infancy, encephalopathy leads to difficulty feeding, an inability to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). infants with megdel syndrome later develop involuntary muscle tensing (dystonia) and muscle stiffness (spasticity), which worsen over time. because of these brain and muscle problems, affected babies have delayed development of mental and movement abilities (psychomotor delay), or they may lose skills they already developed. individuals with megdel syndrome have intellectual disability and never learn to speak. people with megdel syndrome have changes in the brain that resemble those in another condition called leigh syndrome. these changes, which can be seen with medical imaging, are referred to as leigh-like disease. other features that occur commonly in megdel syndrome include low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in affected newborns; liver problems (hepatopathy) in infancy, which can be serious but improve by early childhood; and episodes of abnormally high amounts of lactic acid in the blood (lactic acidosis). the life expectancy of individuals with megdel syndrome is unknown. because of the severe health problems caused by the disorder, some affected individuals do not survive past infancy."
how many people are affected by megdel syndrome ?,megdel syndrome is a rare disorder; its prevalence is unknown. at least 40 affected individuals have been mentioned in the medical literature.

what are the genetic changes related to coffin-siris syndrome ?,"coffin-siris syndrome is caused by mutations in the arid1a, arid1b, smarca4, smarcb1, or smarce1 gene. each of these genes provides instructions for making one piece (subunit) of several different swi/snf protein complexes. swi/snf complexes regulate gene activity (expression) by a process known as chromatin remodeling. chromatin is the network of dna and protein that packages dna into chromosomes. the structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly regions of dna are packaged. chromatin remodeling is one way gene expression is regulated during development; when dna is tightly packed, gene expression is often lower than when dna is loosely packed. through their ability to regulate gene activity, swi/snf complexes are involved in many processes, including repairing damaged dna; copying (replicating) dna; and controlling the growth, division, and maturation (differentiation) of cells. although it is unclear what effect mutations in these genes have on swi/snf complexes, researchers suggest that the mutations result in abnormal chromatin remodeling. disturbance of this process alters the activity of many genes and disrupts several cellular processes, which could explain the diverse signs and symptoms of coffin-siris syndrome."

what is (are) actin-accumulation myopathy ?,"actin-accumulation myopathy is a disorder that primarily affects skeletal muscles, which are muscles that the body uses for movement. people with actin-accumulation myopathy have severe muscle weakness (myopathy) and poor muscle tone (hypotonia) throughout the body. signs and symptoms of this condition are apparent in infancy and include feeding and swallowing difficulties, a weak cry, and difficulty with controlling head movements. affected babies are sometimes described as ""floppy"" and may be unable to move on their own. the severe muscle weakness that occurs in actin-accumulation myopathy also affects the muscles used for breathing. individuals with this disorder may take shallow breaths (hypoventilate), especially during sleep, resulting in a shortage of oxygen and a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood. frequent respiratory infections and life-threatening breathing difficulties can occur. because of the respiratory problems, most affected individuals do not survive past infancy. those who do survive have delayed development of motor skills such as sitting, crawling, standing, and walking. the name actin-accumulation myopathy derives from characteristic accumulations in muscle cells of filaments composed of a protein called actin. these filaments can be seen when muscle tissue is viewed under a microscope."
what is (are) carbamoyl phosphate synthetase i deficiency ?,"carbamoyl phosphate synthetase i deficiency is an inherited disorder that causes ammonia to accumulate in the blood (hyperammonemia). ammonia, which is formed when proteins are broken down in the body, is toxic if the levels become too high. the brain is especially sensitive to the effects of excess ammonia. in the first few days of life, infants with carbamoyl phosphate synthetase i deficiency typically exhibit the effects of hyperammonemia, which may include unusual sleepiness, poorly regulated breathing rate or body temperature, unwillingness to feed, vomiting after feeding, unusual body movements, seizures, or coma. affected individuals who survive the newborn period may experience recurrence of these symptoms if diet is not carefully managed or if they experience infections or other stressors. they may also have delayed development and intellectual disability. in some people with carbamoyl phosphate synthetase i deficiency, signs and symptoms may be less severe and appear later in life."

how many people are affected by camurati-engelmann disease ?,the prevalence of camurati-engelmann disease is unknown. approximately 200 cases have been reported worldwide.
what are the genetic changes related to camurati-engelmann disease ?,"mutations in the tgfb1 gene cause camurati-engelmann disease. the tgfb1 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called transforming growth factor beta-1 (tgf-1). the tgf-1 protein helps control the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (motility), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). the tgf-1 protein is found throughout the body and plays a role in development before birth, the formation of blood vessels, the regulation of muscle tissue and body fat development, wound healing, and immune system function. tgf-1 is particularly abundant in tissues that make up the skeleton, where it helps regulate bone growth, and in the intricate lattice that forms in the spaces between cells (the extracellular matrix). within cells, the tgf-1 protein is turned off (inactive) until it receives a chemical signal to become active. the tgfb1 gene mutations that cause camurati-engelmann disease result in the production of a tgf-1 protein that is always turned on (active). overactive tgf-1 proteins lead to increased bone density and decreased body fat and muscle tissue, contributing to the signs and symptoms of camurati-engelmann disease. some individuals with camurati-engelmann disease do not have identified mutations in the tgfb1 gene. in these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown."

what is (are) netherton syndrome ?,"netherton syndrome is a disorder that affects the skin, hair, and immune system. newborns with netherton syndrome have skin that is red and scaly (ichthyosiform erythroderma), and the skin may leak fluid. some affected infants are born with a tight, clear sheath covering their skin called a collodion membrane. this membrane is usually shed during the first few weeks of life. because newborns with this disorder are missing the protection provided by normal skin, they are at risk of becoming dehydrated and developing infections in the skin or throughout the body (sepsis), which can be life-threatening. affected babies may also fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). the health of older children and adults with netherton syndrome usually improves, although they often remain underweight and of short stature. after infancy, the severity of the skin abnormalities varies among people with netherton syndrome and can fluctuate over time. the skin may continue to be red and scaly, especially during the first few years of life. some affected individuals have intermittent redness or experience outbreaks of a distinctive skin abnormality called ichthyosis linearis circumflexa, involving patches of multiple ring-like lesions. the triggers for the outbreaks are not known, but researchers suggest that stress or infections may be involved. itchiness is a common problem for affected individuals, and scratching can lead to frequent infections. dead skin cells are shed at an abnormal rate and often accumulate in the ear canals, which can affect hearing if not removed regularly. the skin is abnormally absorbent of substances such as lotions and ointments, which can result in excessive blood levels of some topical medications. because the ability of the skin to protect against heat and cold is impaired, affected individuals may have difficulty regulating their body temperature. people with netherton syndrome have hair that is fragile and breaks easily. some strands of hair vary in diameter, with thicker and thinner spots. this feature is known as bamboo hair, trichorrhexis nodosa, or trichorrhexis invaginata. in addition to the hair on the scalp, the eyelashes and eyebrows may be affected. the hair abnormality in netherton syndrome may not be noticed in infancy because babies often have sparse hair. most people with netherton syndrome have immune system-related problems such as food allergies, hay fever, asthma, or an inflammatory skin disorder called eczema."
how many people are affected by netherton syndrome ?,"netherton syndrome is estimated to affect 1 in 200,000 newborns."
what are the genetic changes related to netherton syndrome ?,"netherton syndrome is caused by mutations in the spink5 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called lekt1. lekt1 is a type of serine peptidase inhibitor. serine peptidase inhibitors control the activity of enzymes called serine peptidases, which break down other proteins. lekt1 is found in the skin and in the thymus, which is a gland located behind the breastbone that plays an important role in the immune system by producing white blood cells called lymphocytes. lekt1 controls the activity of certain serine peptidases in the outer layer of skin (the epidermis), especially the tough outer surface known as the stratum corneum, which provides a sturdy barrier between the body and its environment. serine peptidase enzymes are involved in normal skin shedding by helping to break the connections between cells of the stratum corneum. lekt1 is also involved in normal hair growth, the development of lymphocytes in the thymus, and the control of peptidases that trigger immune system function. mutations in the spink5 gene result in a lekt1 protein that is unable to control serine peptidase activity. the lack of lekt1 function allows the serine peptidases to be abnormally active and break down too many proteins in the stratum corneum. as a result, too much skin shedding takes place, and the stratum corneum is too thin and breaks down easily, resulting in the skin abnormalities that occur in netherton syndrome. loss of lekt1 function also results in abnormal hair growth and immune dysfunction that leads to allergies, asthma, and eczema."
how many people are affected by down syndrome ?,"down syndrome occurs in about 1 in 800 newborns. about 5,300 babies with down syndrome are born in the united states each year, and an estimated 250,000 people in this country have the condition. although women of any age can have a child with down syndrome, the chance of having a child with this condition increases as a woman gets older."
what are the genetic changes related to paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ?,"mutations in the piga gene cause paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. the piga gene provides instructions for making a protein called phosphatidylinositol glycan class a. this protein takes part in a series of steps that produce a molecule called gpi anchor. gpi anchor attaches many different proteins to the cell membrane, thereby ensuring that these proteins are available when needed at the surface of the cell. some gene mutations are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. these changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. in people with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, somatic mutations of the piga gene occur in blood-forming cells called hematopoietic stem cells, which are found mainly in the bone marrow. these mutations result in the production of abnormal blood cells. as the abnormal hematopoietic stem cells multiply, increasing numbers of abnormal blood cells are formed, alongside normal blood cells produced by normal hematopoietic stem cells. the premature destruction of red blood cells seen in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is caused by a component of the immune system called complement. complement consists of a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. to protect the individual's own cells from being destroyed, this process is tightly controlled by complement-regulating proteins. complement-regulating proteins normally protect red blood cells from destruction by complement. in people with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, however, abnormal red blood cells are missing two important complement-regulating proteins that need the gpi anchor protein to attach them to the cell membrane. these red blood cells are prematurely destroyed, leading to hemolytic anemia. research suggests that certain abnormal white blood cells that are also part of the immune system may mistakenly attack normal blood-forming cells, in a malfunction called an autoimmune process. in addition, abnormal hematopoietic stem cells in people with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria may be less susceptible than normal cells to a process called apoptosis, which causes cells to self-destruct when they are damaged or unneeded. these features of the disorder may increase the proportion of abnormal blood cells in the body. the proportion of abnormal blood cells affects the severity of the signs and symptoms of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, including the risk of hemoglobinuria and thrombosis."
what is (are) knobloch syndrome ?,"knobloch syndrome is a rare condition characterized by severe vision problems and a skull defect. a characteristic feature of knobloch syndrome is extreme nearsightedness (high myopia). in addition, several other eye abnormalities are common in people with this condition. most affected individuals have vitreoretinal degeneration, which is breakdown (degeneration) of two structures in the eye called the vitreous and the retina. the vitreous is the gelatin-like substance that fills the eye, and the retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. vitreoretinal degeneration often leads to separation of the retina from the back of the eye (retinal detachment). affected individuals may also have abnormalities in the central area of the retina, called the macula. the macula is responsible for sharp central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. due to abnormalities in the vitreous, retina, and macula, people with knobloch syndrome often develop blindness in one or both eyes. another characteristic feature of knobloch syndrome is a skull defect called an occipital encephalocele, which is a sac-like protrusion of the brain (encephalocele) through a defect in the bone at the base of the skull (occipital bone). some affected individuals have been diagnosed with a different skull defect in the occipital region, and it is unclear whether the defect is always a true encephalocele. in other conditions, encephaloceles may be associated with intellectual disability; however, most people with knobloch syndrome have normal intelligence."
what are the genetic changes related to potassium-aggravated myotonia ?,"mutations in the scn4a gene cause potassium-aggravated myotonia. the scn4a gene provides instructions for making a protein that is critical for the normal function of skeletal muscle cells. for the body to move normally, skeletal muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. muscle contractions are triggered by the flow of positively charged atoms (ions), including sodium, into skeletal muscle cells. the scn4a protein forms channels that control the flow of sodium ions into these cells. mutations in the scn4a gene alter the usual structure and function of sodium channels. the altered channels cannot properly regulate ion flow, increasing the movement of sodium ions into skeletal muscle cells. the influx of extra sodium ions triggers prolonged muscle contractions, which are the hallmark of myotonia."
is potassium-aggravated myotonia inherited ?,"potassium-aggravated myotonia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in some cases, an affected person inherits a mutation in the scn4a gene from one affected parent. other cases result from new mutations in the gene. these cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family."
is krabbe disease inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
is surfactant dysfunction inherited ?,"surfactant dysfunction can have different inheritance patterns depending on its genetic cause. when caused by mutations in the sftpb or abca3 gene, this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. when caused by mutations in the sftpc gene, this condition has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in about half of cases caused by changes in the sftpc gene, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. the remainder result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family."
what are the genetic changes related to sepiapterin reductase deficiency ?,"mutations in the spr gene cause sepiapterin reductase deficiency. the spr gene provides instructions for making the sepiapterin reductase enzyme. this enzyme is involved in the production of a molecule called tetrahydrobiopterin (also known as bh4). specifically, sepiapterin reductase is responsible for the last step in the production of tetrahydrobiopterin. tetrahydrobiopterin helps process several building blocks of proteins (amino acids), and is involved in the production of chemicals called neurotransmitters, which transmit signals between nerve cells in the brain. spr gene mutations disrupt the production of sepiapterin reductase. most spr gene mutations result in an enzyme with little or no function. a nonfunctional sepiapterin reductase leads to a lack of tetrahydrobiopterin. in most parts of the body, there are alternate pathways that do not use sepiapterin reductase for the production of tetrahydrobiopterin, but these pathways are not found in the brain. therefore, people with sepiapterin reductase deficiency have a lack of tetrahydrobiopterin in the brain. when no tetrahydrobiopterin is produced in the brain, production of dopamine and serotonin is greatly reduced. among their many functions, dopamine transmits signals within the brain to produce smooth physical movements, and serotonin regulates mood, emotion, sleep, and appetite. the lack of these two neurotransmitters causes the problems with movement and other features of sepiapterin reductase deficiency."
what is (are) lesch-nyhan syndrome ?,"lesch-nyhan syndrome is a condition that occurs almost exclusively in males. it is characterized by neurological and behavioral abnormalities and the overproduction of uric acid. uric acid is a waste product of normal chemical processes and is found in blood and urine. excess uric acid can be released from the blood and build up under the skin and cause gouty arthritis (arthritis caused by an accumulation of uric acid in the joints). uric acid accumulation can also cause kidney and bladder stones. the nervous system and behavioral disturbances experienced by people with lesch-nyhan syndrome include abnormal involuntary muscle movements, such as tensing of various muscles (dystonia), jerking movements (chorea), and flailing of the limbs (ballismus). people with lesch-nyhan syndrome usually cannot walk, require assistance sitting, and generally use a wheelchair. self-injury (including biting and head banging) is the most common and distinctive behavioral problem in individuals with lesch-nyhan syndrome."

what is (are) warsaw breakage syndrome ?,"warsaw breakage syndrome is a condition that can cause multiple abnormalities. people with warsaw breakage syndrome have intellectual disability that varies from mild to severe. they also have impaired growth from birth leading to short stature and a small head size (microcephaly). affected individuals have distinctive facial features that may include a small forehead, a short nose, a small lower jaw, a flat area between the nose and mouth (philtrum), and prominent cheeks. other common features include hearing loss caused by nerve damage in the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss) and heart malformations."
what is (are) laing distal myopathy ?,"laing distal myopathy is a condition that affects skeletal muscles, which are muscles that the body uses for movement. this disorder causes progressive muscle weakness that appears in childhood. the first sign of laing distal myopathy is usually weakness in certain muscles in the feet and ankles. this weakness leads to tightening of the achilles tendon (the band that connects the heel of the foot to the calf muscles), an inability to lift the first (big) toe, and a high-stepping walk. months to years later, muscle weakness develops in the hands and wrists. weakness in these muscles makes it difficult to lift the fingers, particularly the third and fourth fingers. many affected people also experience hand tremors. in addition to muscle weakness in the hands and feet, laing distal myopathy causes weakness in several muscles of the neck and face. a decade or more after the onset of symptoms, mild weakness also spreads to muscles in the legs, hips, and shoulders. laing distal myopathy progresses very gradually, and most affected people remain mobile throughout life. life expectancy is normal in people with this condition."

what is (are) optic atrophy type 1 ?,"optic atrophy type 1 is a condition that affects vision. individuals with this condition have progressive vision loss that typically begins within the first decade of life. the severity of the vision loss varies widely among affected people, even among members of the same family. people with this condition can range from having nearly normal vision to complete blindness. the vision loss usually progresses slowly. people with optic atrophy type 1 frequently have problems with color vision that make it difficult or impossible to distinguish between shades of blue and green. other vision problems associated with this condition include a progressive narrowing of the field of vision (tunnel vision) and an abnormally pale appearance (pallor) of the nerve that relays visual information from the eye to the brain (optic nerve). optic nerve pallor can be detected during an eye examination."
what are the genetic changes related to optic atrophy type 1 ?,"optic atrophy type 1 is caused by mutations in the opa1 gene. the protein produced from this gene is made in many types of cells and tissues throughout the body. the opa1 protein is found inside mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers of cells. the opa1 protein plays a key role in the organization of the shape and structure of the mitochondria and in the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). the opa1 protein is also involved in a process called oxidative phosphorylation, from which cells derive much of their energy. additionally, the protein plays a role in the maintenance of the small amount of dna within mitochondria, called mitochondrial dna (mtdna). mutations in the opa1 gene lead to overall dysfunction of mitochondria. the structure of the mitochondria become disorganized and cells are more susceptible to self-destruction. opa1 gene mutations lead to mitochondria with reduced energy-producing capabilities. the maintenance of mtdna is also sometimes impaired, resulting in mtdna mutations. the vision problems experienced by people with optic atrophy type 1 are due to mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to the breakdown of structures that transmit visual information from the eyes to the brain. affected individuals first experience a progressive loss of nerve cells within the retina, called retinal ganglion cells. the loss of these cells is followed by the degeneration (atrophy) of the optic nerve. the optic nerve is partly made up of specialized extensions of retinal ganglion cells called axons; when the retinal ganglion cells die, the optic nerve cannot transmit visual information to the brain normally. it is unclear why the opa1 gene mutations that cause optic atrophy type 1 only affect the eyes. retinal ganglion cells have many mitochondria and especially high energy requirements, which researchers believe may make them particularly vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreases in energy production. some individuals with optic atrophy type 1 do not have identified mutations in the opa1 gene. in these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown."

is intestinal pseudo-obstruction inherited ?,"intestinal pseudo-obstruction is often not inherited. when it does run in families, it can have different inheritance patterns. intestinal pseudo-obstruction caused by flna gene mutations is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. the flna gene is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by x-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons. intestinal pseudo-obstruction can also be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in other families it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. when intestinal pseudo-obstruction is inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pattern, the genetic cause of the disorder is unknown. when intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a feature of mngie disease, it is inherited in a mitochondrial pattern, which is also known as maternal inheritance. this pattern of inheritance applies to genes contained in mitochondrial dna (mtdna). because egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, children can only inherit disorders resulting from mtdna mutations from their mother. these disorders can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females, but fathers do not pass traits associated with changes in mtdna to their children. in some cases, the inheritance pattern is unknown."
how many people are affected by catsper1-related nonsyndromic male infertility ?,the prevalence of catsper1-related nonsyndromic male infertility is unknown.
is catsper1-related nonsyndromic male infertility inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show symptoms of the condition. males with two catsper1 gene mutations in each cell have catsper1-related nonsyndromic male infertility. females with two catsper1 gene mutations in each cell have no symptoms because the mutations only affect sperm function, and women do not produce sperm."

is nonsyndromic hearing loss inherited ?,"as discussed above, nonsyndromic hearing loss has different patterns of inheritance. between 75 and 80 percent of cases are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. usually, each parent of an individual with autosomal recessive hearing loss carries one copy of the mutated gene but does not have hearing loss. another 20 to 25 percent of nonsyndromic hearing loss has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. most people with autosomal dominant hearing loss inherit an altered copy of the gene from a parent who also has hearing loss. between 1 and 2 percent of cases have an x-linked pattern of inheritance. a condition is considered x-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the x chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes in each cell. males with x-linked nonsyndromic hearing loss tend to develop more severe hearing loss earlier in life than females who inherit a copy of the same gene mutation. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons. mitochondrial forms of the condition, which result from changes to mtdna, account for less than 1 percent of all nonsyndromic hearing loss in the united states. these cases are inherited in a mitochondrial pattern, which is also known as maternal inheritance. this pattern of inheritance applies to genes contained in mtdna. because egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, children can only inherit disorders resulting from mtdna mutations from their mother. these disorders can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females, but fathers do not pass traits associated with changes in mtdna to their children. in some cases, hearing loss occurs in people with no history of the condition in their family. these cases are described as sporadic, and the cause of the hearing loss is often unknown. when hearing loss results from environmental factors, it is not inherited."

what are the genetic changes related to fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva ?,"mutations in the acvr1 gene cause fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. the acvr1 gene provides instructions for producing a member of a protein family called bone morphogenetic protein (bmp) type i receptors. the acvr1 protein is found in many tissues of the body including skeletal muscle and cartilage. it helps to control the growth and development of the bones and muscles, including the gradual replacement of cartilage by bone (ossification) that occurs in normal skeletal maturation from birth to young adulthood. researchers believe that a mutation in the acvr1 gene may change the shape of the receptor under certain conditions and disrupt mechanisms that control the receptor's activity. as a result, the receptor may be constantly turned on (constitutive activation). constitutive activation of the receptor causes overgrowth of bone and cartilage and fusion of joints, resulting in the signs and symptoms of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva."
is fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. most cases of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva result from new mutations in the gene. these cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. in a small number of cases, an affected person has inherited the mutation from one affected parent."
is ataxia with oculomotor apraxia inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
is saddan inherited ?,"saddan is considered an autosomal dominant disorder because one mutated copy of the fgfr3 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. the few described cases of saddan have been caused by new mutations in the fgfr3 gene and occurred in people with no history of the disorder in their family. no individuals with this disorder are known to have had children; therefore, the disorder has not been passed to the next generation."

what are the genetic changes related to cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia ?,"cn-aml is classified as ""cytogenetically normal"" based on the type of genetic changes involved in its development. cytogenetically normal refers to the fact that this form of acute myeloid leukemia is not associated with large chromosomal abnormalities. about half of people with acute myeloid leukemia have this form of the condition; the other half have genetic changes that alter large regions of certain chromosomes. these changes can be identified by a test known as cytogenetic analysis. cn-aml is associated with smaller genetic changes that cannot be seen by cytogenetic analysis. mutations in a large number of genes have been found in people with cn-aml; the most commonly affected genes are npm1, flt3, dnmt3a, cebpa, idh1, and idh2. the proteins produced from these genes have different functions in the cell. most are involved in regulating processes such as the growth and division (proliferation), maturation (differentiation), or survival of cells. for example, the protein produced from the flt3 gene stimulates the proliferation and survival of cells. the proteins produced from the cebpa and dnmt3a genes regulate gene activity and help to control when cells divide and how they mature. the npm1 gene provides instructions for a protein that is likely involved in the regulation of cell growth and division. mutations in any of these genes can disrupt one or more of these processes in hematopoietic stem cells and lead to overproduction of abnormal, immature white blood cells, which is characteristic of cn-aml. although the proteins produced from two other genes involved in cn-aml, idh1 and idh2, are not normally involved in proliferation, differentiation, or survival of cells, mutations in these genes lead to the production of proteins with a new function. these changes result in impaired differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells, which leads to cn-aml. cn-aml is a complex condition influenced by several genetic and environmental factors. typically, mutations in more than one gene are involved. for example, people with an npm1 gene mutation frequently also have a mutation in the flt3 gene, both of which are likely involved in the cancer's development. in addition, environmental factors such as smoking or exposure to radiation increase an individual's risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia."
how many people are affected by prothrombin deficiency ?,prothrombin deficiency is very rare; it is estimated to affect 1 in 2 million people in the general population.
how many people are affected by familial exudative vitreoretinopathy ?,"the prevalence of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy is unknown. it appears to be rare, although affected people with normal vision may never come to medical attention."
what are the genetic changes related to familial exudative vitreoretinopathy ?,"mutations in the fzd4, lrp5, and ndp genes can cause familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. these genes provide instructions for making proteins that participate in a chemical signaling pathway that affects the way cells and tissues develop. in particular, the proteins produced from the fzd4, lrp5, and ndp genes appear to play critical roles in the specialization of retinal cells and the establishment of a blood supply to the retina and the inner ear. the lrp5 protein also helps regulate bone formation. mutations in the fzd4, lrp5, or ndp gene disrupt chemical signaling during early development, which interferes with the formation of blood vessels at the edges of the retina. the resulting abnormal blood supply to this tissue leads to retinal damage and vision loss in some people with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. the eye abnormalities associated with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy tend to be similar no matter which gene is altered. however, affected individuals with lrp5 gene mutations often have reduced bone mineral density in addition to vision loss. mutations in the other genes responsible for familial exudative vitreoretinopathy do not appear to affect bone density. in some cases, the cause of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy is unknown. researchers believe that mutations in several as-yet-unidentified genes are responsible for the disorder in these cases."
how many people are affected by geleophysic dysplasia ?,geleophysic dysplasia is a rare disorder whose prevalence is unknown. more than 30 affected individuals have been reported.
is 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria inherited ?,"d-2-hga type i, l-2-hga, and combined d,l-2-hga all have an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. d-2-hga type ii is considered an autosomal dominant disorder because one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. the disorder typically results from a new mutation in the idh2 gene and occurs in people with no history of the condition in their family."
what is (are) dubin-johnson syndrome ?,"dubin-johnson syndrome is a condition characterized by jaundice, which is a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. in most affected people jaundice appears during adolescence or early adulthood, although a few individuals have been diagnosed soon after birth. jaundice is typically the only symptom of dubin-johnson syndrome, but some people also experience weakness, mild upper abdominal pain, nausea, and/or vomiting."
what are the genetic changes related to allergic asthma ?,"the cause of allergic asthma is complex. it is likely that a combination of multiple genetic and environmental factors contribute to development of the condition. doctors believe genes are involved because having a family member with allergic asthma or another allergic disorder increases a person's risk of developing asthma. studies suggest that more than 100 genes may be associated with allergic asthma, but each seems to be a factor in only one or a few populations. many of the associated genes are involved in the body's immune response. others play a role in lung and airway function. there is evidence that an unbalanced immune response underlies allergic asthma. while there is normally a balance between type 1 (or th1) and type 2 (or th2) immune reactions in the body, many individuals with allergic asthma predominantly have type 2 reactions. type 2 reactions lead to the production of immune proteins called ige antibodies and the generation of other factors that predispose to bronchial hyperresponsiveness. normally, the body produces ige antibodies in response to foreign invaders, particularly parasitic worms. for unknown reasons, in susceptible individuals, the body reacts to an allergen as if it is harmful, producing ige antibodies specific to it. upon later encounters with the allergen, ige antibodies recognize it, which stimulates an immune response, causing bronchoconstriction, airway swelling, and mucus production. not everyone with a variation in one of the allergic asthma-associated genes develops the condition; exposure to certain environmental factors also contributes to its development. studies suggest that these exposures trigger epigenetic changes to the dna. epigenetic changes modify dna without changing the dna sequence. they can affect gene activity and regulate the production of proteins, which may influence the development of allergies in susceptible individuals."

what is (are) congenital afibrinogenemia ?,"congenital afibrinogenemia is a bleeding disorder caused by impairment of the blood clotting process. normally, blood clots protect the body after an injury by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss. however, bleeding is uncontrolled in people with congenital afibrinogenemia. newborns with this condition often experience prolonged bleeding from the umbilical cord stump after birth. nosebleeds (epistaxis) and bleeding from the gums or tongue are common and can occur after minor trauma or in the absence of injury (spontaneous bleeding). some affected individuals experience bleeding into the spaces between joints (hemarthrosis) or the muscles (hematoma). rarely, bleeding in the brain or other internal organs occurs, which can be fatal. women with congenital afibrinogenemia can have abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia). without proper treatment, women with this disorder may have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term, resulting in repeated miscarriages."
is epidermolysis bullosa with pyloric atresia inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."

what are the genetic changes related to microvillus inclusion disease ?,"mutations in the myo5b gene cause microvillus inclusion disease. the myo5b gene provides instructions for making a protein called myosin vb. this protein helps to determine the position of various components within cells (cell polarity). myosin vb also plays a role in moving components from the cell membrane to the interior of the cell for recycling. myo5b gene mutations that cause microvillus inclusion disease result in a decrease or absence of myosin vb function. in cells that line the small intestine (enterocytes), a lack of myosin vb function changes the cell polarity. as a result, enterocytes cannot properly form structures called microvilli, which normally project like small fingers from the surface of the cells and absorb nutrients and fluids from food as it passes through the intestine. inside affected enterocytes, small clumps of abnormal microvilli mix with misplaced digestive proteins to form microvillus inclusions, which contribute to the dysfunction of enterocytes. disorganized enterocytes with poorly formed microvilli reduce the intestine's ability to take in nutrients. the inability to absorb nutrients and fluids during digestion leads to recurrent diarrhea, malnutrition, and dehydration in individuals with microvillus inclusion disease. some people with the signs and symptoms of microvillus inclusion disease do not have mutations in the myo5b gene. these cases may be variants of microvillus inclusion disease. studies suggest that mutations in other genes can cause these cases, but the causes are usually unknown."

how many people are affected by prostate cancer ?,"about 1 in 7 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some time during their life. in addition, studies indicate that many older men have undiagnosed prostate cancer that is non-aggressive and unlikely to cause symptoms or affect their lifespan. while most men who are diagnosed with prostate cancer do not die from it, this common cancer is still the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the united states. more than 60 percent of prostate cancers are diagnosed after age 65, and the disorder is rare before age 40. in the united states, african americans have a higher risk of developing prostate cancer than do men of other ethnic backgrounds, and they also have a higher risk of dying from the disease."
what is (are) essential thrombocythemia ?,"essential thrombocythemia is a condition characterized by an increased number of platelets (thrombocythemia). platelets (thrombocytes) are blood cell fragments involved in blood clotting. while some people with this condition have no symptoms, others develop problems associated with the excess platelets. abnormal blood clotting (thrombosis) is common in people with essential thrombocythemia and causes many signs and symptoms of this condition. clots that block blood flow to the brain can cause strokes or temporary stroke-like episodes known as transient ischemic attacks. thrombosis in the legs can cause leg pain, swelling, or both. in addition, clots can travel to the lungs (pulmonary embolism), blocking blood flow in the lungs and causing chest pain and difficulty breathing (dyspnea). another problem in essential thrombocythemia is abnormal bleeding, which occurs more often in people with a very high number of platelets. affected people may have nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. it is thought that bleeding occurs because a specific protein in the blood that helps with clotting is reduced, although why the protein is reduced is unclear. other signs and symptoms of essential thrombocythemia include an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly); weakness; headaches; or a sensation in the skin of burning, tingling, or prickling. some people with essential thrombocythemia have episodes of severe pain, redness, and swelling (erythromelalgia), which commonly occur in the hands and feet."

what are the genetic changes related to familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ?,"familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis may be caused by mutations in any of several genes. these genes provide instructions for making proteins that help destroy or deactivate lymphocytes that are no longer needed. by controlling the number of activated lymphocytes, these genes help regulate immune system function. approximately 40 to 60 percent of cases of familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis are caused by mutations in the prf1 or unc13d genes. smaller numbers of cases are caused by mutations in other known genes. in some affected individuals, the genetic cause of the disorder is unknown. the gene mutations that cause familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis impair the body's ability to regulate the immune system. these changes result in the exaggerated immune response characteristic of this condition."
what is (are) brody myopathy ?,"brody myopathy is a condition that affects the skeletal muscles, which are the muscles used for movement. affected individuals experience muscle cramping and stiffening after exercise or other strenuous activity, especially in cold temperatures. these symptoms typically begin in childhood. they are usually painless, but in some cases can cause mild discomfort. the muscles usually relax after a few minutes of rest. most commonly affected are the muscles of the arms, legs, and face (particularly the eyelids). in some people with brody myopathy, exercise leads to the breakdown of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis). the destruction of muscle tissue releases a protein called myoglobin, which is processed by the kidneys and released in the urine (myoglobinuria). myoglobin causes the urine to be red or brown."
what is (are) ollier disease ?,"ollier disease is a disorder characterized by multiple enchondromas, which are noncancerous (benign) growths of cartilage that develop within the bones. these growths most commonly occur in the limb bones, especially in the bones of the hands and feet; however, they may also occur in the skull, ribs, and bones of the spine (vertebrae). enchondromas may result in severe bone deformities, shortening of the limbs, and fractures. the signs and symptoms of ollier disease may be detectable at birth, although they generally do not become apparent until around the age of 5. enchondromas develop near the ends of bones, where normal growth occurs, and they frequently stop forming after affected individuals stop growing in early adulthood. as a result of the bone deformities associated with ollier disease, people with this disorder generally have short stature and underdeveloped muscles. although the enchondromas associated with ollier disease start out as benign, they may become cancerous (malignant). in particular, affected individuals may develop bone cancers called chondrosarcomas, especially in the skull. people with ollier disease also have an increased risk of other cancers, such as ovarian or liver cancer. people with ollier disease usually have a normal lifespan, and intelligence is unaffected. the extent of their physical impairment depends on their individual skeletal deformities, but in most cases they have no major limitations in their activities. a related disorder called maffucci syndrome also involves multiple enchondromas but is distinguished by the presence of red or purplish growths in the skin consisting of tangles of abnormal blood vessels (hemangiomas)."
how many people are affected by ollier disease ?,"ollier disease is estimated to occur in 1 in 100,000 people."
is ollier disease inherited ?,"ollier disease is not inherited. the mutations that cause this disorder are somatic, which means they occur during a person's lifetime. a somatic mutation occurs in a single cell. as that cell continues to grow and divide, the cells derived from it also have the same mutation. in ollier disease, the mutation is thought to occur in a cell during early development before birth; cells that arise from that abnormal cell have the mutation, while the body's other cells do not. this situation is called mosaicism."
what are the genetic changes related to factor xiii deficiency ?,"inherited factor xiii deficiency results from mutations in the f13a1 gene or, less commonly, the f13b gene. these genes provide instructions for making the two parts (subunits) of a protein called factor xiii. this protein plays a critical role in the coagulation cascade, which is a series of chemical reactions that forms blood clots in response to injury. after an injury, clots seal off blood vessels to stop bleeding and trigger blood vessel repair. factor xiii acts at the end of the cascade to strengthen and stabilize newly formed clots, preventing further blood loss. mutations in the f13a1 or f13b gene significantly reduce the amount of functional factor xiii available to participate in blood clotting. in most people with the inherited form of the condition, factor xiii levels in the bloodstream are less than 5 percent of normal. a loss of this protein's activity weakens blood clots, preventing the clots from stopping blood loss effectively. the acquired form of factor xiii deficiency results when the production of factor xiii is reduced or when the body uses factor xiii faster than cells can replace it. acquired factor xiii deficiency is generally mild because levels of factor xiii in the bloodstream are 20 to 70 percent of normal; levels above 10 percent of normal are usually adequate to prevent spontaneous bleeding episodes. acquired factor xiii deficiency can be caused by disorders including an inflammatory disease of the liver called hepatitis, scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), inflammatory bowel disease, overwhelming bacterial infections (sepsis), and several types of cancer. acquired factor xiii deficiency can also be caused by abnormal activation of the immune system, which produces specialized proteins called autoantibodies that attack and disable the factor xiii protein. the production of autoantibodies against factor xiii is sometimes associated with immune system diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. in other cases, the trigger for autoantibody production is unknown."

what are the genetic changes related to spastic paraplegia type 11 ?,"mutations in the spg11 gene cause spastic paraplegia type 11. the spg11 gene provides instructions for making the protein spatacsin. spatacsin is active (expressed) throughout the nervous system, although its exact function is unknown. researchers speculate that spatacsin may be involved in the maintenance of axons, which are specialized extensions of nerve cells (neurons) that transmit impulses throughout the nervous system. spg11 gene mutations typically change the structure of the spatacsin protein. the effect that the altered spatacsin protein has on the nervous system is not known. researchers suggest that mutations in spatacsin may cause the signs and symptoms of spastic paraplegia type 11 by interfering with the protein's proposed role in the maintenance of axons."
what is (are) thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome ?,"thrombocytopenia-absent radius (tar) syndrome is characterized by the absence of a bone called the radius in each forearm. affected individuals also have a shortage (deficiency) of blood cells involved in clotting (platelets). this platelet deficiency (thrombocytopenia) usually appears during infancy and becomes less severe over time; in some cases the platelet levels become normal. thrombocytopenia prevents normal blood clotting, resulting in easy bruising and frequent nosebleeds. potentially life-threatening episodes of severe bleeding (hemorrhages) may occur in the brain and other organs, especially during the first year of life. hemorrhages can damage the brain and lead to intellectual disability. affected children who survive this period and do not have damaging hemorrhages in the brain usually have a normal life expectancy and normal intellectual development. tar syndrome is unusual among similar malformations in that affected individuals have thumbs, while people with other conditions involving an absent radius typically do not. tar syndrome is also associated with short stature and additional skeletal abnormalities, including underdevelopment of other bones in the arms and legs. affected individuals may also have malformations of the heart and kidneys. tar syndrome is associated with unusual facial features including a small lower jaw (micrognathia), a prominent forehead, and low-set ears. about half of affected individuals have allergic reactions to cow's milk that may worsen the thrombocytopenia associated with this disorder."
what is (are) cystic fibrosis ?,"cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease characterized by the buildup of thick, sticky mucus that can damage many of the body's organs. the disorder's most common signs and symptoms include progressive damage to the respiratory system and chronic digestive system problems. the features of the disorder and their severity varies among affected individuals. mucus is a slippery substance that lubricates and protects the linings of the airways, digestive system, reproductive system, and other organs and tissues. in people with cystic fibrosis, the body produces mucus that is abnormally thick and sticky. this abnormal mucus can clog the airways, leading to severe problems with breathing and bacterial infections in the lungs. these infections cause chronic coughing, wheezing, and inflammation. over time, mucus buildup and infections result in permanent lung damage, including the formation of scar tissue (fibrosis) and cysts in the lungs. most people with cystic fibrosis also have digestive problems. some affected babies have meconium ileus, a blockage of the intestine that occurs shortly after birth. other digestive problems result from a buildup of thick, sticky mucus in the pancreas. the pancreas is an organ that produces insulin (a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels). it also makes enzymes that help digest food. in people with cystic fibrosis, mucus blocks the ducts of the pancreas, reducing the production of insulin and preventing digestive enzymes from reaching the intestines to aid digestion. problems with digestion can lead to diarrhea, malnutrition, poor growth, and weight loss. in adolescence or adulthood, a shortage of insulin can cause a form of diabetes known as cystic fibrosis-related diabetes mellitus (cfrdm). cystic fibrosis used to be considered a fatal disease of childhood. with improved treatments and better ways to manage the disease, many people with cystic fibrosis now live well into adulthood. adults with cystic fibrosis experience health problems affecting the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems. most men with cystic fibrosis have congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (cbavd), a condition in which the tubes that carry sperm (the vas deferens) are blocked by mucus and do not develop properly. men with cbavd are unable to father children (infertile) unless they undergo fertility treatment. women with cystic fibrosis may experience complications in pregnancy."
what is (are) guillain-barr syndrome ?,"guillain-barr syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that affects the nerves. autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. in guillain-barr syndrome, the immune response damages peripheral nerves, which are the nerves that connect the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) to the limbs and organs. specifically, the immune response affects a particular part of peripheral nerves called axons, which are the extensions of nerve cells (neurons) that transmit nerve impulses. guillain-barr syndrome can affect the neurons that control muscle movement (motor neurons); the neurons that transmit sensory signals such as pain, temperature, and touch (sensory neurons); or both. as a result, affected individuals can experience muscle weakness or lose the ability to feel certain sensations. muscle weakness or paralysis are the characteristic features of guillain-barr syndrome. the weakness often begins in the legs and spreads to the arms, torso, and face and is commonly accompanied by numbness, tingling, or pain. additional signs and symptoms of the condition include difficulty swallowing and difficulty breathing. occasionally, the nerves that control involuntary functions of the body such as blood pressure and heart rate are affected, which can lead to fluctuating blood pressure or an abnormal heartbeat (cardiac arrhythmia). there are several types of guillain-barr syndrome, classified by the part of the peripheral nerve involved in the condition. the most common type of guillain-barr syndrome is acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (aidp). in aidp, the immune response damages myelin, which is the covering that protects axons and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. in two other types of guillain-barr syndrome, acute motor axonal neuropathy (aman) and acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy (amsan), the axons themselves are damaged by the immune response. in aman, only the axons of motor neurons are damaged. in amsan, the axons of sensory neurons are also damaged. because of sensory nerve damage, affected individuals can lose the ability to sense the position of their limbs and can have abnormal or absent reflexes (areflexia). miller fisher syndrome, another type of guillain-barr syndrome, involves cranial nerves, which extend from the brain to various areas of the head and neck. miller fisher syndrome is characterized by three features: weakness or paralysis of the muscles that move the eyes (ophthalmoplegia), problems with balance and coordination (ataxia), and areflexia. people with this condition can have other signs and symptoms common in guillain-barr syndrome, such as muscle weakness. guillain-barr syndrome occurs in people of all ages. the development of the condition usually follows a pattern. prior to developing the condition, most people with guillain-barr syndrome have a bacterial or viral infection. the first phase of guillain-barr syndrome, during which signs and symptoms of the condition worsen, can last up to four weeks, although the peak of the illness is usually reached in one to two weeks. during the second phase, called the plateau, signs and symptoms of guillain-barr syndrome stabilize. this phase can last weeks or months. during the recovery phase, symptoms improve. however, some people with guillain-barr syndrome never fully recover and can still experience excessive tiredness (fatigue), muscle weakness, or muscle pain."

how many people are affected by spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 ?,"the prevalence of sca2 is unknown. this condition is estimated to be one of the most common types of spinocerebellar ataxia; however, all types of spinocerebellar ataxia are relatively rare. sca2 is more common in cuba, particularly in the holgun province, where approximately 40 per 100,000 individuals are affected."
how many people are affected by cushing disease ?,"cushing disease is estimated to occur in 10 to 15 per million people worldwide. for reasons that are unclear, cushing disease affects females more often than males."
is cushing disease inherited ?,"most cases of cushing disease are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. rarely, the condition has been reported to run in families; however, it does not have a clear pattern of inheritance. the various syndromes that have cushing disease as a feature can have different inheritance patterns. most of these disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder."
"what are the genetic changes related to distal hereditary motor neuropathy, type ii ?","mutations in the hspb1 and hspb8 genes cause distal hereditary motor neuropathy, type ii. these genes provide instructions for making proteins called heat shock protein beta-1 and heat shock protein beta-8. heat shock proteins help protect cells under adverse conditions such as infection, inflammation, exposure to toxins, elevated temperature, injury, and disease. they block signals that lead to programmed cell death. in addition, they appear to be involved in activities such as cell movement (motility), stabilizing the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton), folding and stabilizing newly produced proteins, and repairing damaged proteins. heat shock proteins also appear to play a role in the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction). heat shock protein beta-1 and heat shock protein beta-8 are found in cells throughout the body and are abundant in nerve cells. in nerve cells, heat shock protein beta-1 helps to organize a network of molecular threads called neurofilaments that maintain the diameter of specialized extensions called axons. maintaining proper axon diameter is essential for the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. the function of heat shock protein beta-8 is not well understood, but studies have shown that it interacts with heat shock protein beta-1. the hspb1 and hspb8 gene mutations that cause distal hereditary motor neuropathy, type ii change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the protein sequence. if either protein is altered, they may be more likely to cluster together and form clumps (aggregates). aggregates of heat shock proteins may block the transport of substances that are essential for the proper function of nerve axons. the disruption of other cell functions in which these proteins are involved may also contribute to the signs and symptoms of distal hereditary motor neuropathy, type ii."
is erdheim-chester disease inherited ?,this condition is not inherited. it arises from a somatic mutation in histiocytes or their precursor cells during an individual's lifetime.
how many people are affected by histidinemia ?,"estimates of the incidence of histidinemia vary widely, ranging between 1 in 8,600 to 1 in 90,000 people."
what are the genetic changes related to histidinemia ?,"histidinemia is caused by mutations in the hal gene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called histidase. histidase breaks down histidine to a molecule called urocanic acid. histidase is active (expressed) primarily in the liver and the skin. hal gene mutations lead to the production of a histidase enzyme that cannot break down histidine, which results in elevated levels of histidine in the blood and urine. these increased levels of histidine do not appear to have any negative effects on the body."

what is (are) recurrent hydatidiform mole ?,"recurrent hydatidiform mole occurs when women have at least two abnormal pregnancies described as hydatidiform moles. a hydatidiform mole occurs early in pregnancy when an embryo does not fully develop and the placenta develops abnormally. the placenta is a solid structure in the uterus that normally provides nutrients to a growing fetus. if a hydatidiform mole occurs once, it is known a sporadic hydatidiform mole; if it happens again, the condition is known as recurrent hydatidiform mole. a hydatidiform mole often causes vaginal bleeding in the first trimester of the pregnancy. in an ultrasound examination, the abnormal placenta appears as numerous small sacs, often described as resembling a bunch of grapes. in some cases, the ultrasound shows no fetus, umbilical cord, or amniotic sac (a fluid-filled sac that normally surrounds the fetus). hydatidiform moles are not naturally discharged from the body and must be surgically removed, typically by the end of the first trimester. after removal, there is up to a 20 percent risk that any tissue left behind (persistent mole) will continue to grow and become a cancerous tumor called an invasive mole. the invasive mole can transform into a different form of cancer called gestational choriocarcinoma that can spread (metastasize) to other tissues such as the liver, lungs, or brain."
what is (are) antiphospholipid syndrome ?,"antiphospholipid syndrome is a disorder characterized by an increased tendency to form abnormal blood clots (thromboses) that can block blood vessels. this clotting tendency is known as thrombophilia. in antiphospholipid syndrome, the thromboses can develop in nearly any blood vessel in the body, but most frequently occur in the vessels of the lower limbs. if a blood clot forms in the vessels in the brain, blood flow is impaired and can lead to stroke. antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disorder. autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. women with antiphospholipid syndrome are at increased risk of complications during pregnancy. these complications include pregnancy-induced high blood pressure (preeclampsia), an underdeveloped placenta (placental insufficiency), early delivery, or pregnancy loss (miscarriage). in addition, women with antiphospholipid syndrome are at greater risk of having a thrombosis during pregnancy than at other times during their lives. at birth, infants of mothers with antiphospholipid syndrome may be small and underweight. a thrombosis or pregnancy complication is typically the first sign of antiphospholipid syndrome. this condition usually appears in early to mid-adulthood but can begin at any age. other signs and symptoms of antiphospholipid syndrome that affect blood cells and vessels include a reduced amount of blood clotting cells called platelets (thrombocytopenia), a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) due to their premature breakdown (hemolysis), and a purplish skin discoloration (livedo reticularis) caused by abnormalities in the tiny blood vessels of the skin. in addition, affected individuals may have open sores (ulcers) on the skin, migraine headaches, heart disease, or intellectual disability. many people with antiphospholipid syndrome also have other autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus. rarely, people with antiphospholipid syndrome develop thromboses in multiple blood vessels throughout their body. these thromboses block blood flow in affected organs, which impairs their function and ultimately causes organ failure. these individuals are said to have catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (caps). caps typically affects the kidneys, lungs, brain, heart, and liver, and is fatal in over half of affected individuals. less than 1 percent of individuals with antiphospholipid syndrome develop caps."
what are the genetic changes related to steatocystoma multiplex ?,"steatocystoma multiplex can be caused by mutations in the krt17 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called keratin 17, which is produced in the nails, the hair follicles, and the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. it is also found in the skin's sebaceous glands. keratin 17 partners with a similar protein called keratin 6b to form networks that provide strength and resilience to the skin, nails, and other tissues. the krt17 gene mutations that cause steatocystoma multiplex alter the structure of keratin 17, preventing it from forming strong, stable networks within cells. the defective keratin network disrupts the growth and function of cells in the skin and nails, including cells that make up the sebaceous glands. these abnormalities lead to the growth of sebum-containing cysts in people with steatocystoma multiplex. however, it is unclear why steatocystomas are typically the only feature of this disorder. many researchers believe that steatocystoma multiplex is a variant form of a disorder called pachyonychia congenita, which can also result from mutations in the krt17 gene. like steatocystoma multiplex, pachyonychia congenita involves the growth of steatocystomas. pachyonychia congenita is also associated with more severe skin and nail abnormalities not usually found in people with steatocystoma multiplex. in some cases, people with steatocystoma multiplex do not have an identified mutation in the krt17 gene. the cause of the condition in these individuals is unknown."
what is (are) isolated ectopia lentis ?,"isolated ectopia lentis is a condition that affects the eyes, specifically the positioning of the lens. the lens is a clear structure at the front of the eye that helps focus light. in people with isolated ectopia lentis, the lens in one or both eyes is not centrally positioned as it should be but is off-center (displaced). isolated ectopia lentis usually becomes apparent in childhood. the lens may drift further off-center over time. vision problems are common in isolated ectopia lentis. affected individuals often have nearsightedness (myopia) and can have an irregular curvature of the lens or a structure that covers the front of the eye (the cornea), which causes blurred vision (astigmatism). they may also develop clouding of the lenses (cataracts) or increased pressure in the eyes (glaucoma) at an earlier age than other adults. in a small number of people with isolated ectopia lentis, tearing of the back lining of the eye (retinal detachment) occurs, which can lead to further vision problems and possible blindness. in individuals with isolated ectopia lentis, each eye can be affected differently. in addition, the eye problems vary among affected individuals, even those within the same family. ectopia lentis is classified as isolated when it occurs alone without signs and symptoms affecting other body systems. ectopia lentis can also be classified as syndromic, when it is part of a syndrome that affects multiple parts of the body. ectopia lentis is a common feature of genetic syndromes such as marfan syndrome and weill-marchesani syndrome."

what are the genetic changes related to ornithine translocase deficiency ?,"mutations in the slc25a15 gene cause ornithine translocase deficiency. ornithine translocase deficiency belongs to a class of genetic diseases called urea cycle disorders. the urea cycle is a sequence of reactions that occurs in liver cells. this cycle processes excess nitrogen, generated when protein is used by the body, to make a compound called urea that is excreted by the kidneys. the slc25a15 gene provides instructions for making a protein called a mitochondrial ornithine transporter. this protein is needed to move a molecule called ornithine within the mitochondria (the energy-producing centers in cells). specifically, this protein transports ornithine across the inner membrane of mitochondria to the region called the mitochondrial matrix, where it participates in the urea cycle. mutations in the slc25a15 gene result in a mitochondrial ornithine transporter that is unstable or the wrong shape, and which cannot bring ornithine to the mitochondrial matrix. this failure of ornithine transport causes an interruption of the urea cycle and the accumulation of ammonia, resulting in the signs and symptoms of ornithine translocase deficiency."
what is (are) klippel-trenaunay syndrome ?,"klippel-trenaunay syndrome is a condition that affects the development of blood vessels, soft tissues, and bones. the disorder has three characteristic features: a red birthmark called a port-wine stain, abnormal overgrowth of soft tissues and bones, and vein malformations. most people with klippel-trenaunay syndrome are born with a port-wine stain. this type of birthmark is caused by swelling of small blood vessels near the surface of the skin. port-wine stains are typically flat and can vary from pale pink to deep maroon in color. in people with klippel-trenaunay syndrome, the port-wine stain usually covers part of one limb. the affected area may become lighter or darker with age. occasionally, port-wine stains develop small red blisters that break open and bleed easily. klippel-trenaunay syndrome is also associated with overgrowth of bones and soft tissues beginning in infancy. usually this abnormal growth is limited to one limb, most often one leg. however, overgrowth can also affect the arms or, rarely, the trunk. the abnormal growth can cause pain, a feeling of heaviness, and reduced movement in the affected area. if the overgrowth causes one leg to be longer than the other, it can also lead to problems with walking. malformations of veins are the third major feature of klippel-trenaunay syndrome. these abnormalities include varicose veins, which are swollen and twisted veins near the surface of the skin that often cause pain. varicose veins usually occur on the sides of the upper legs and calves. veins deep in the limbs can also be abnormal in people with klippel-trenaunay syndrome. malformations of deep veins increase the risk of a type of clot called a deep vein thrombosis (dvt). if a dvt travels through the bloodstream and lodges in the lungs, it can cause a life-threatening clot known as a pulmonary embolism (pe). complications of klippel-trenaunay syndrome can include a type of skin infection called cellulitis, swelling caused by a buildup of fluid (lymphedema), and internal bleeding from abnormal blood vessels. less commonly, this condition is also associated with fusion of certain fingers or toes (syndactyly) or the presence of extra digits (polydactyly)."
how many people are affected by klippel-trenaunay syndrome ?,"klippel-trenaunay syndrome is estimated to affect at least 1 in 100,000 people worldwide."
is wilson disease inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
how many people are affected by neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus ?,"neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus is thought to be rare, although its exact incidence is unknown. the acquired form occurs much more frequently than the familial form."
how many people are affected by globozoospermia ?,"globozoospermia is a rare condition that is estimated to affect 1 in 65,000 men. it is most common in north africa, where it accounts for approximately 1 in 100 cases of male infertility."
how many people are affected by meckel syndrome ?,"meckel syndrome affects 1 in 13,250 to 1 in 140,000 people worldwide. it is more common in certain populations; for example, the condition affects about 1 in 9,000 people of finnish ancestry and about 1 in 3,000 people of belgian ancestry."
what are the genetic changes related to meckel syndrome ?,"meckel syndrome can be caused by mutations in one of at least eight genes. the proteins produced from these genes are known or suspected to play roles in cell structures called cilia. cilia are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells and are involved in signaling pathways that transmit information between cells. cilia are important for the structure and function of many types of cells, including brain cells and certain cells in the kidneys and liver. mutations in the genes associated with meckel syndrome lead to problems with the structure and function of cilia. defects in these cell structures probably disrupt important chemical signaling pathways during early development. although researchers believe that defective cilia are responsible for most of the features of this disorder, it remains unclear how they lead to specific developmental abnormalities of the brain, kidneys, and other parts of the body. mutations in the eight genes known to be associated with meckel syndrome account for about 75 percent of all cases of the condition. in the remaining cases, the genetic cause is unknown. mutations in several other genes have been identified in people with features similar to those of meckel syndrome, although it is unclear whether these individuals actually have meckel syndrome or a related disorder (often described as a ""meckel-like phenotype"")."
how many people are affected by fraser syndrome ?,"fraser syndrome affects an estimated 1 in 200,000 newborns. the condition occurs in approximately 1 in 10,000 fetuses that do not survive to birth."
is fraser syndrome inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what are the genetic changes related to bradyopsia ?,"bradyopsia can be caused by mutations in the rgs9 gene or in the rgs9bp gene (which is also known as r9ap). these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are necessary for normal vision. the proteins are found in light-detecting cells in the eye called photoreceptors. when light enters the eye, it stimulates specialized pigments in these cells. this stimulation triggers a series of chemical reactions that produce an electrical signal, which is interpreted by the brain as vision. once photoreceptors have been stimulated by light, they must return to their resting state before they can be stimulated again. the rgs9 and rgs9bp proteins play an essential role in returning photoreceptors to their resting state quickly after light exposure. mutations in either the rgs9 or rgs9bp gene prevent photoreceptors from recovering quickly after responding to light. normally they return to their resting state in a fraction of a second, but in people with mutations in one of these genes, it can take ten seconds or longer. during that time, the photoreceptors cannot respond to light. this delay causes temporary blindness in response to changing light conditions and interferes with seeing small objects when they are in motion. in some people with bradyopsia, no mutations in the rgs9 or rgs9bp gene have been found. the cause of the condition in these individuals is unknown."
how many people are affected by severe congenital neutropenia ?,"the incidence of severe congenital neutropenia is estimated to be 1 in 200,000 individuals."
what is (are) nonsyndromic paraganglioma ?,"paraganglioma is a type of noncancerous (benign) tumor that occurs in structures called paraganglia. paraganglia are groups of cells that are found near nerve cell bunches called ganglia. paragangliomas are usually found in the head, neck, or torso. however, a type of paraganglioma known as pheochromocytoma develops in the adrenal glands. adrenal glands are located on top of each kidney and produce hormones in response to stress. most people with paraganglioma develop only one tumor in their lifetime. some people develop a paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma as part of a hereditary syndrome that may affect other organs and tissues in the body. however, the tumors often are not associated with any syndromes, in which case the condition is called nonsyndromic paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma. pheochromocytomas and some other paragangliomas are associated with ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system. the sympathetic nervous system controls the ""fight-or-flight"" response, a series of changes in the body due to hormones released in response to stress. although most sympathetic paragangliomas are pheochromocytomas, some are found outside the adrenal glands, usually in the abdomen, and are called extra-adrenal paragangliomas. most sympathetic paragangliomas, including pheochromocytomas, produce hormones called catecholamines, such as epinephrine (adrenaline) or norepinephrine. these excess catecholamines can cause signs and symptoms such as high blood pressure (hypertension), episodes of rapid heartbeat (palpitations), headaches, or sweating. most paragangliomas are associated with ganglia of the parasympathetic nervous system, which controls involuntary body functions such as digestion and saliva formation. parasympathetic paragangliomas, typically found in the head and neck, usually do not produce hormones. however, large tumors may cause signs and symptoms such as coughing, hearing loss in one ear, or difficulty swallowing. although most paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas are noncancerous, some can become cancerous (malignant) and spread to other parts of the body (metastasize). extra-adrenal paragangliomas become malignant more often than other types of paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma."
is 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."

is ring chromosome 20 syndrome inherited ?,"ring chromosome 20 syndrome is almost never inherited. a ring chromosome typically occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development. often, the ring chromosome is present in only some of a person's cells. this situation is known as mosaicism. most affected individuals have no history of the disorder in their families. however, at least one family has been reported in which a ring chromosome 20 was passed from a mother to her children."
how many people are affected by rothmund-thomson syndrome ?,rothmund-thomson syndrome is a rare disorder; its incidence is unknown. about 300 people with this condition have been reported worldwide in scientific studies.
is polycystic kidney disease inherited ?,"most cases of polycystic kidney disease have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. people with this condition are born with one mutated copy of the pkd1 or pkd2 gene in each cell. in about 90 percent of these cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. the other 10 percent of cases result from a new mutation in one of the genes and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. although one altered copy of a gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder, an additional mutation in the second copy of the pkd1 or pkd2 gene may make cysts grow faster and increase the severity of the disease. the rate at which cysts enlarge and cause a loss of kidney function varies widely, and may be influenced by mutations in other genes that have not been identified. polycystic kidney disease also can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. people with this form of the condition have two altered copies of the pkhd1 gene in each cell. the parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are not affected but are carriers of one copy of the altered gene."
what is (are) distal myopathy 2 ?,"distal myopathy 2 is a condition characterized by weakness of specific muscles that begins in adulthood. it is a form of muscular dystrophy that specifically involves muscles in the throat, lower legs, and forearms. muscles farther from the center of the body, like the muscles of the lower legs and forearms, are known as distal muscles. muscle weakness in the ankles is usually the first symptom of distal myopathy 2. the weakness can also affect muscles in the hands, wrists, and shoulders. at first, the muscle weakness may be on only one side of the body, but both sides are eventually involved. this muscle weakness can slowly worsen and make actions like walking and lifting the fingers difficult. another characteristic feature of distal myopathy 2 is weakness of the vocal cords and throat. this weakness initially causes the voice to sound weak or breathy (hypophonic). eventually, the voice becomes gurgling, hoarse, and nasal. the weakness can also cause difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)."
is distal myopathy 2 inherited ?,"distal myopathy 2 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered matr3 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder."
is lowe syndrome inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an x-linked pattern. a condition is considered x-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the x chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation must be present in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. most x-linked disorders affect males much more frequently than females. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons. in some cases of lowe syndrome, an affected male inherits the mutation from a mother who carries one altered copy of the ocrl gene. other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in males with no history of the disorder in their family. females who carry one mutated copy of the ocrl gene do not have the characteristic features of lowe syndrome. most female carriers, however, have changes in the lens of the eye that can be observed with a thorough eye examination. these changes typically do not impair vision."

how many people are affected by renal tubular dysgenesis ?,"renal tubular dysgenesis is a rare disorder, but its prevalence is unknown."
what is (are) multiminicore disease ?,"multiminicore disease is a disorder that primarily affects muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). this condition causes muscle weakness and related health problems that range from mild to life-threatening. researchers have identified at least four forms of multiminicore disease, which can be distinguished by their characteristic signs and symptoms. the most common form, called the classic form, causes muscle weakness beginning in infancy or early childhood. this weakness is most noticeable in muscles of the trunk and neck (axial muscles) and is less severe in the arm and leg muscles. muscle weakness causes affected infants to appear ""floppy"" (hypotonic) and can delay the development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking. the disease causes muscles of the ribcage and spine to stiffen. when combined with weakness of the muscles needed for breathing, this stiffness leads to severe or life-threatening respiratory problems. almost all children with multiminicore disease develop an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), which appears during childhood and steadily worsens over time. other forms of multiminicore disease have different patterns of signs and symptoms. they are less common than the classic form, together accounting for about 25 percent of all cases. the atypical forms of the condition tend to be milder and cause few or no problems with breathing. the moderate form with hand involvement causes muscle weakness and looseness of the joints, particularly in the arms and hands. another form of multiminicore disease, known as the antenatal form with arthrogryposis, is characterized by stiff, rigid joints throughout the body (arthrogryposis), distinctive facial features, and other birth defects. paralysis of the eye muscles (external ophthalmoplegia) is a primary feature of another atypical form of multiminicore disease. this form of the condition also causes general muscle weakness and feeding difficulties that appear in the first year of life. many people with multiminicore disease also have an increased risk of a developing a severe reaction to certain drugs used during surgery and other invasive procedures. this reaction is called malignant hyperthermia. malignant hyperthermia occurs in response to some anesthetic gases, which are used to block the sensation of pain, and with a particular type of muscle relaxant. if given these drugs, people at risk for malignant hyperthermia may experience muscle rigidity, breakdown of muscle fibers (rhabdomyolysis), a high fever, increased acid levels in the blood and other tissues (acidosis), and a rapid heart rate. the complications of malignant hyperthermia can be life-threatening unless they are treated promptly. multiminicore disease gets its name from small, disorganized areas called minicores, which are found in muscle fibers of many affected individuals. these abnormal regions can only be seen under a microscope. although the presence of minicores can help doctors diagnose multiminicore disease, it is unclear how they are related to muscle weakness and the other features of this condition."

what is (are) glut1 deficiency syndrome ?,"glut1 deficiency syndrome is a disorder affecting the nervous system that can have a variety of neurological signs and symptoms. approximately 90 percent of affected individuals have a form of the disorder often referred to as common glut1 deficiency syndrome. these individuals generally have frequent seizures (epilepsy) beginning in the first months of life. in newborns, the first sign of the disorder may be involuntary eye movements that are rapid and irregular. babies with common glut1 deficiency syndrome have a normal head size at birth, but growth of the brain and skull is often slow, which can result in an abnormally small head size (microcephaly). people with this form of glut1 deficiency syndrome may have developmental delay or intellectual disability. most affected individuals also have other neurological problems, such as stiffness caused by abnormal tensing of the muscles (spasticity), difficulty in coordinating movements (ataxia), and speech difficulties (dysarthria). some experience episodes of confusion, lack of energy (lethargy), headaches, or muscle twitches (myoclonus), particularly during periods without food (fasting). about 10 percent of individuals with glut1 deficiency syndrome have a form of the disorder often known as non-epileptic glut1 deficiency syndrome, which is usually less severe than the common form. people with the non-epileptic form do not have seizures, but they may still have developmental delay and intellectual disability. most have movement problems such as ataxia or involuntary tensing of various muscles (dystonia); the movement problems may be more pronounced than in the common form. several conditions that were originally given other names have since been recognized to be variants of glut1 deficiency syndrome. these include paroxysmal choreoathetosis with spasticity (dystonia 9); paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia and epilepsy (dystonia 18); and certain types of epilepsy. in rare cases, people with variants of glut1 deficiency syndrome produce abnormal red blood cells and have uncommon forms of a blood condition known as anemia, which is characterized by a shortage of red blood cells."
what is (are) permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus ?,"permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus is a type of diabetes that first appears within the first 6 months of life and persists throughout the lifespan. this form of diabetes is characterized by high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) resulting from a shortage of the hormone insulin. insulin controls how much glucose (a type of sugar) is passed from the blood into cells for conversion to energy. individuals with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus experience slow growth before birth (intrauterine growth retardation). affected infants have hyperglycemia and an excessive loss of fluids (dehydration) and are unable to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). in some cases, people with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus also have certain neurological problems, including developmental delay and recurrent seizures (epilepsy). this combination of developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes is called dend syndrome. intermediate dend syndrome is a similar combination but with milder developmental delay and without epilepsy. a small number of individuals with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus have an underdeveloped pancreas. because the pancreas produces digestive enzymes as well as secreting insulin and other hormones, affected individuals experience digestive problems such as fatty stools and an inability to absorb fat-soluble vitamins."
how many people are affected by permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus ?,"about 1 in 400,000 infants are diagnosed with diabetes mellitus in the first few months of life. however, in about half of these babies the condition is transient and goes away on its own by age 18 months. the remainder are considered to have permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus."

what is (are) hand-foot-genital syndrome ?,"hand-foot-genital syndrome is a rare condition that affects the development of the hands and feet, the urinary tract, and the reproductive system. people with this condition have abnormally short thumbs and first (big) toes, small fifth fingers that curve inward (clinodactyly), short feet, and fusion or delayed hardening of bones in the wrists and ankles. the other bones in the arms and legs are normal. abnormalities of the genitals and urinary tract can vary among affected individuals. many people with hand-foot-genital syndrome have defects in the ureters, which are tubes that carry urine from each kidney to the bladder, or in the urethra, which carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. recurrent urinary tract infections and an inability to control the flow of urine (urinary incontinence) have been reported. about half of males with this disorder have the urethra opening on the underside of the penis (hypospadias). people with hand-foot-genital syndrome are usually able to have children (fertile). in some affected females, problems in the early development of the uterus can later increase the risk of pregnancy loss, premature labor, and stillbirth."
what are the genetic changes related to hand-foot-genital syndrome ?,"mutations in the hoxa13 gene cause hand-foot-genital syndrome. the hoxa13 gene provides instructions for producing a protein that plays an important role in development before birth. specifically, this protein appears to be critical for the formation and development of the limbs (particularly the hands and feet), urinary tract, and reproductive system. mutations in the hoxa13 gene cause the characteristic features of hand-foot-genital syndrome by disrupting the early development of these structures. some mutations in the hoxa13 gene result in the production of a nonfunctional version of the hoxa13 protein. other mutations alter the protein's structure and interfere with its normal function within cells. mutations that result in an altered but functional hoxa13 protein may cause more severe signs and symptoms than mutations that lead to a nonfunctional hoxa13 protein."

what are the genetic changes related to dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome ?,"dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome is caused by mutations in the slc6a3 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called the dopamine transporter. this protein is embedded in the membrane of certain nerve cells (neurons) in the brain, where it transports a molecule called dopamine into the cell. dopamine is a chemical messenger (neurotransmitter) that relays signals from one neuron to another. dopamine has many important functions, including playing complex roles in thought (cognition), motivation, behavior, and control of movement. mutations in the slc6a3 gene impair or eliminate the function of the dopamine transporter. the resulting shortage (deficiency) of functional transporter disrupts dopamine signaling in the brain. although dopamine has a critical role in controlling movement, it is unclear how altered dopamine signaling causes the specific movement abnormalities found in people with dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome. studies suggest that the age at which signs and symptoms appear is related to how severely the function of the dopamine transporter is affected. affected individuals who develop movement problems starting in infancy most often have transporter activity that is less than 5 percent of normal. those whose movement problems appear in childhood or later tend to have somewhat higher levels of transporter activity, although they are still lower than normal. researchers speculate that higher levels of transporter activity may delay the onset of the disease in these individuals."
what are the genetic changes related to clouston syndrome ?,"clouston syndrome is caused by mutations in the gjb6 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called gap junction beta 6, more commonly known as connexin 30. connexin 30 is a member of the connexin protein family. connexin proteins form channels called gap junctions, which permit the transport of nutrients, charged atoms (ions), and signaling molecules between neighboring cells. the size of the gap junction and the types of particles that move through it are determined by the particular connexin proteins that make up the channel. gap junctions made with connexin 30 transport potassium ions and certain small molecules. connexin 30 is found in several different tissues throughout the body, including the skin (especially on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet), hair follicles, and nail beds, and plays a role in the growth and development of these tissues. gjb6 gene mutations that cause clouston syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the connexin 30 protein. although the effects of these mutations are not fully understood, they lead to abnormalities in the growth, division, and maturation of cells in the hair follicles, nails, and skin."
what is (are) triosephosphate isomerase deficiency ?,"triosephosphate isomerase deficiency is a disorder characterized by a shortage of red blood cells (anemia), movement problems, increased susceptibility to infection, and muscle weakness that can affect breathing and heart function. the anemia in this condition begins in infancy. since the anemia results from the premature breakdown of red blood cells (hemolysis), it is known as hemolytic anemia. a shortage of red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body leads to extreme tiredness (fatigue), pale skin (pallor), and shortness of breath. when the red cells are broken down, iron and a molecule called bilirubin are released; individuals with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency have an excess of these substances circulating in the blood. excess bilirubin in the blood causes jaundice, which is a yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. movement problems typically become apparent by age 2 in people with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. the movement problems are caused by impairment of motor neurons, which are specialized nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control muscle movement. this impairment leads to muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy) and causes the movement problems typical of triosephosphate isomerase deficiency, including involuntary muscle tensing (dystonia), tremors, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). affected individuals may also develop seizures. weakness of other muscles, such as the heart (a condition known as cardiomyopathy) and the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm) can also occur in triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. diaphragm weakness can cause breathing problems and ultimately leads to respiratory failure. individuals with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency are at increased risk of developing infections because they have poorly functioning white blood cells. these immune system cells normally recognize and attack foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, to prevent infection. the most common infections in people with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency are bacterial infections of the respiratory tract. people with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency often do not survive past childhood due to respiratory failure. in a few rare cases, affected individuals without severe nerve damage or muscle weakness have lived into adulthood."
how many people are affected by triosephosphate isomerase deficiency ?,triosephosphate isomerase deficiency is likely a rare condition; approximately 40 cases have been reported in the scientific literature.

what are the genetic changes related to abetalipoproteinemia ?,"mutations in the mttp gene cause abetalipoproteinemia. the mttp gene provides instructions for making a protein called microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, which is essential for creating beta-lipoproteins. these lipoproteins are necessary for the absorption of fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins from the diet and the efficient transport of these substances in the bloodstream. most of the mutations in the mttp gene lead to the production of an abnormally short microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, which prevents the normal creation of beta-lipoproteins in the body. a lack of beta-lipoproteins causes the nutritional and neurological problems seen in people with abetalipoproteinemia."
is chylomicron retention disease inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."

is spondylocostal dysostosis inherited ?,"spondylocostal dysostosis can have different inheritance patterns. types 1, 2, 3, and 4 are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. ad spondylocostal dysostosis is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder, although in these cases no causative genes have been identified. the signs and symptoms of spondylocostal dysostosis are typically more severe with autosomal recessive inheritance."
what is (are) narcolepsy ?,"narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder that disrupts the normal sleep-wake cycle. although this condition can appear at any age, it most often begins in adolescence. narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness. affected individuals feel tired during the day, and several times a day they may experience an overwhelming urge to sleep. ""sleep attacks"" can occur at unusual times, such as during a meal or in the middle of a conversation. they last from a few seconds to a few minutes and often lead to a longer nap, after which affected individuals wake up feeling refreshed. another common feature of narcolepsy is cataplexy, which is a sudden loss of muscle tone in response to strong emotion (such as laughing, surprise, or anger). these episodes of muscle weakness can cause an affected person to slump over or fall, which occasionally leads to injury. episodes of cataplexy usually last just a few seconds, and they may occur from several times a day to a few times a year. most people diagnosed with narcolepsy also have cataplexy. however, some do not, which has led researchers to distinguish two major forms of the condition: narcolepsy with cataplexy and narcolepsy without cataplexy. narcolepsy also affects nighttime sleep. most affected individuals have trouble sleeping for more than a few hours at night. they often experience vivid hallucinations while falling asleep (hypnogogic hallucinations) or while waking up (hypnopompic hallucinations). affected individuals often have realistic and distressing dreams, and they may act out their dreams by moving excessively or talking in their sleep. many people with narcolepsy also experience sleep paralysis, which is an inability to move or speak for a short period while falling asleep or awakening. the combination of hallucinations, vivid dreams, and sleep paralysis is often frightening and unpleasant for affected individuals. some people with narcolepsy have all of the major features of the disorder, while others have only one or two. most of the signs and symptoms persist throughout life, although episodes of cataplexy may become less frequent with age and treatment."
how many people are affected by narcolepsy ?,"narcolepsy affects about 1 in 2,000 people in the united states and western europe. however, the disorder is likely underdiagnosed, particularly in people with mild symptoms. worldwide, narcolepsy appears to be most common in japan, where it affects an estimated 1 in 600 people."
is retinal arterial macroaneurysm with supravalvular pulmonic stenosis inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what are the genetic changes related to x-linked severe combined immunodeficiency ?,"mutations in the il2rg gene cause x-linked scid. the il2rg gene provides instructions for making a protein that is critical for normal immune system function. this protein is necessary for the growth and maturation of developing immune system cells called lymphocytes. lymphocytes defend the body against potentially harmful invaders, make antibodies, and help regulate the entire immune system. mutations in the il2rg gene prevent these cells from developing and functioning normally. without functional lymphocytes, the body is unable to fight off infections."
what is (are) von willebrand disease ?,"von willebrand disease is a bleeding disorder that slows the blood clotting process, causing prolonged bleeding after an injury. people with this condition often experience easy bruising, long-lasting nosebleeds, and excessive bleeding or oozing following an injury, surgery, or dental work. mild forms of von willebrand disease may become apparent only when abnormal bleeding occurs following surgery or a serious injury. women with this condition typically have heavy or prolonged bleeding during menstruation (menorrhagia), and some may also experience reproductive tract bleeding during pregnancy and childbirth. in severe cases of von willebrand disease, heavy bleeding occurs after minor trauma or even in the absence of injury (spontaneous bleeding). symptoms of von willebrand disease may change over time. increased age, pregnancy, exercise, and stress may cause bleeding symptoms to become less frequent. von willebrand disease is divided into three types, with type 2 being further divided into four subtypes. type 1 is the mildest and most common of the three types, accounting for 75 percent of affected individuals. type 3 is the most severe and rarest form of the condition. the four subtypes of type 2 von willebrand disease are intermediate in severity. another form of the disorder, acquired von willebrand syndrome, is not caused by inherited gene mutations. acquired von willebrand syndrome is typically seen along with other disorders, such as diseases that affect bone marrow or immune cell function. this rare form of the condition is characterized by abnormal bleeding into the skin and other soft tissues, usually beginning in adulthood."
how many people are affected by von willebrand disease ?,"von willebrand disease is estimated to affect 1 in 100 to 10,000 individuals. because people with mild signs and symptoms may not come to medical attention, it is thought that this condition is underdiagnosed. most researchers agree that von willebrand disease is the most common genetic bleeding disorder."
how many people are affected by schinzel-giedion syndrome ?,"schinzel-giedion syndrome is very rare, although the exact prevalence is unknown."
is schinzel-giedion syndrome inherited ?,schinzel-giedion syndrome results from new mutations in the setbp1 gene and occurs in people with no history of the disorder in their family. one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.
how many people are affected by capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome ?,"cm-avm is thought to occur in at least 1 in 100,000 people of northern european origin. the prevalence of the condition in other populations is unknown."
is capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family."
what are the genetic changes related to familial dysautonomia ?,"mutations in the ikbkap gene cause familial dysautonomia. the ikbkap gene provides instructions for making a protein called ikk complex-associated protein (ikap). this protein is found in a variety of cells throughout the body, including brain cells. nearly all individuals with familial dysautonomia have two copies of the same ikbkap gene mutation in each cell. this mutation can disrupt how information in the ikbkap gene is pieced together to make a blueprint for the production of ikap protein. as a result of this error, a reduced amount of normal ikap protein is produced. this mutation behaves inconsistently, however. some cells produce near normal amounts of the protein, and other cellsparticularly brain cellshave very little of the protein. critical activities in brain cells are probably disrupted by reduced amounts or the absence of ikap protein, leading to the signs and symptoms of familial dysautonomia."
what are the genetic changes related to brooke-spiegler syndrome ?,"brooke-spiegler syndrome is caused by mutations in the cyld gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps regulate nuclear factor-kappa-b. nuclear factor-kappa-b is a group of related proteins that help protect cells from self-destruction (apoptosis) in response to certain signals. in regulating the action of nuclear factor-kappa-b, the cyld protein allows cells to respond properly to signals to self-destruct when appropriate, such as when the cells become abnormal. by this mechanism, the cyld protein acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it helps prevent cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way. people with brooke-spiegler syndrome are born with a mutation in one of the two copies of the cyld gene in each cell. this mutation prevents the cell from making functional cyld protein from the altered copy of the gene. however, enough protein is usually produced from the other, normal copy of the gene to regulate cell growth effectively. for tumors to develop, a second mutation or deletion of genetic material involving the other copy of the cyld gene must occur in certain cells during a person's lifetime. when both copies of the cyld gene are mutated in a particular cell, that cell cannot produce any functional cyld protein. the loss of this protein allows the cell to grow and divide in an uncontrolled way to form a tumor. in people with brooke-spiegler syndrome, a second cyld mutation typically occurs in multiple cells over an affected person's lifetime. the loss of cyld protein in different types of cells in the skin leads to the growth of a variety of skin appendage tumors. some researchers consider brooke-spiegler syndrome and two related conditions called multiple familial trichoepithelioma and familial cylindromatosis, which are also caused by cyld gene mutations, to be different forms of the same disorder. it is unclear why mutations in the cyld gene cause different patterns of skin appendage tumors in each of these conditions, or why the tumors are generally confined to the skin in these disorders."
is brooke-spiegler syndrome inherited ?,"susceptibility to brooke-spiegler syndrome has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell increases the risk of developing this condition. however, a second, non-inherited mutation is required for development of skin appendage tumors in this disorder."
what are the genetic changes related to feingold syndrome ?,"mutations in the mycn gene cause feingold syndrome. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in the formation of tissues and organs during embryonic development. studies in animals suggest that this protein is necessary for normal development of the limbs, heart, kidneys, nervous system, digestive system, and lungs. the mycn protein regulates the activity of other genes by attaching (binding) to specific regions of dna. on the basis of this action, this protein is called a transcription factor. mutations in the mycn gene that cause feingold syndrome prevent one copy of the gene in each cell from producing any functional mycn protein. as a result, only half the normal amount of this protein is available to control the activity of specific genes during embryonic development. it remains unclear how a reduced amount of the mycn protein causes the specific features of feingold syndrome."
what are the genetic changes related to neuroblastoma ?,"neuroblastoma and other cancers occur when a buildup of genetic mutations in critical genesthose that control cell growth and division (proliferation) or maturation (differentiation)allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. in most cases, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are called somatic mutations. somatic mutations are present only in certain cells and are not inherited. when neuroblastoma is associated with somatic mutations, it is called sporadic neuroblastoma. it is thought that somatic mutations in at least two genes are required to cause sporadic neuroblastoma. less commonly, gene mutations that increase the risk of developing cancer can be inherited from a parent. when the mutation associated with neuroblastoma is inherited, the condition is called familial neuroblastoma. mutations in the alk and phox2b genes have been shown to increase the risk of developing sporadic and familial neuroblastoma. it is likely that there are other genes involved in the formation of neuroblastoma. several mutations in the alk gene are involved in the development of sporadic and familial neuroblastoma. the alk gene provides instructions for making a protein called anaplastic lymphoma kinase. although the specific function of this protein is unknown, it appears to play an important role in cell proliferation. mutations in the alk gene result in an abnormal version of anaplastic lymphoma kinase that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). constitutively active anaplastic lymphoma kinase may induce abnormal proliferation of immature nerve cells and lead to neuroblastoma. several mutations in the phox2b gene have been identified in sporadic and familial neuroblastoma. the phox2b gene is important for the formation and differentiation of nerve cells. mutations in this gene are believed to interfere with the phox2b protein's role in promoting nerve cell differentiation. this disruption of differentiation results in an excess of immature nerve cells and leads to neuroblastoma. deletion of certain regions of chromosome 1 and chromosome 11 are associated with neuroblastoma. researchers believe the deleted regions in these chromosomes could contain a gene that keeps cells from growing and dividing too quickly or in an uncontrolled way, called a tumor suppressor gene. when a tumor suppressor gene is deleted, cancer can occur. the kif1b gene is a tumor suppressor gene located in the deleted region of chromosome 1, and mutations in this gene have been identified in some people with familial neuroblastoma, indicating it is involved in neuroblastoma development or progression. there are several other possible tumor suppressor genes in the deleted region of chromosome 1. no tumor suppressor genes have been identified in the deleted region of chromosome 11. another genetic change found in neuroblastoma is associated with the severity of the disease but not thought to cause it. about 25 percent of people with neuroblastoma have extra copies of the mycn gene, a phenomenon called gene amplification. it is unknown how amplification of this gene contributes to the aggressive nature of neuroblastoma."
what is (are) benign chronic pemphigus ?,"benign chronic pemphigus, often called hailey-hailey disease, is a rare skin condition that usually appears in early adulthood. the disorder is characterized by red, raw, and blistered areas of skin that occur most often in skin folds, such as the groin, armpits, neck, and under the breasts. these inflamed areas can become crusty or scaly and may itch and burn. the skin problems tend to worsen with exposure to moisture (such as sweat), friction, and hot weather. the severity of benign chronic pemphigus varies from relatively mild episodes of skin irritation to widespread, persistent areas of raw and blistered skin that interfere with daily activities. affected skin may become infected with bacteria or fungi, leading to pain and odor. although the condition is described as ""benign"" (noncancerous), in rare cases the skin lesions may develop into a form of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma. many affected individuals also have white lines running the length of their fingernails. these lines do not cause any problems, but they can be useful for diagnosing benign chronic pemphigus."
what is (are) fuchs endothelial dystrophy ?,"fuchs endothelial dystrophy is a condition that causes vision problems. the first symptom of this condition is typically blurred vision in the morning that usually clears during the day. over time, affected individuals lose the ability to see details (visual acuity). people with fuchs endothelial dystrophy also become sensitive to bright lights. fuchs endothelial dystrophy specifically affects the front surface of the eye called the cornea. deposits called guttae, which are detectable during an eye exam, form in the middle of the cornea and eventually spread. these guttae contribute to the loss of cells in the cornea, leading to vision problems. tiny blisters may develop on the cornea, which can burst and cause eye pain. the signs and symptoms of fuchs endothelial dystrophy usually begin in a person's forties or fifties. a very rare early-onset variant of this condition starts to affect vision in a person's twenties."
how many people are affected by dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency ?,"dopamine -hydroxylase deficiency is a very rare disorder. fewer than 20 affected individuals, all of western european descent, have been described in the scientific literature."
what are the genetic changes related to congenital hepatic fibrosis ?,"syndromes of which congenital hepatic fibrosis is a feature may be caused by changes in many different genes. the gene changes that cause isolated congenital hepatic fibrosis are unknown. congenital hepatic fibrosis is caused by problems in the development of the portal veins and bile ducts. these problems include malformation of embryonic structures called ductal plates. each ductal plate is a cylinder of cells surrounding branches of the portal veins. during development before birth, the ductal plates normally develop into the network of bile ducts. in congenital hepatic fibrosis, the development of the ductal plates does not proceed normally, resulting in the persistence of immature bile ducts. branching of the portal vein network also proceeds abnormally, and excess fibrous tissue develops in the portal tracts. the malformation of the portal veins and bile ducts disrupts the normal flow of blood and bile, which leads to the progressive signs and symptoms of congenital hepatic fibrosis."
what are the genetic changes related to dandy-walker malformation ?,"researchers have found mutations in a few genes that are thought to cause dandy-walker malformation, but these mutations account for only a small number of cases. dandy-walker malformation has also been associated with many chromosomal abnormalities. this condition can be a feature of some conditions in which there is an extra copy of one chromosome in each cell (trisomy). dandy-walker malformation most often occurs in people with trisomy 18 (an extra copy of chromosome 18), but can also occur in people with trisomy 13, trisomy 21, or trisomy 9. this condition can also be associated with missing (deletions) or copied (duplications) pieces of certain chromosomes. dandy-walker malformation can also be a feature of genetic syndromes that are caused by mutations in specific genes. however, the brain malformations associated with dandy-walker malformation often occur as an isolated feature (not associated with other health problems), and in these cases the cause is frequently unknown. research suggests that dandy-walker malformation could be caused by environmental factors that affect early development before birth. for example, exposure of the fetus to substances that cause birth defects (teratogens) may be involved in the development of this condition. in addition, a mother with diabetes is more likely than a healthy mother to have a child with dandy-walker malformation."
is dandy-walker malformation inherited ?,"most cases of dandy-walker malformation are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. a small percentage of cases seem to run in families; however, dandy-walker malformation does not have a clear pattern of inheritance. multiple genetic and environmental factors likely play a part in determining the risk of developing this disorder. first-degree relatives (such as siblings and children) of people with dandy-walker malformation have an increased risk of developing the condition compared with people in the general population. when dandy-walker malformation is a feature of a genetic condition, it is inherited in the pattern of that condition."

what are the genetic changes related to benign essential blepharospasm ?,"the causes of benign essential blepharospasm are unknown, although the disorder likely results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. certain genetic changes probably increase the likelihood of developing this condition, and environmental factors may trigger the signs and symptoms in people who are at risk. studies suggest that this condition may be related to other forms of adult-onset dystonia, including uncontrolled twisting of the neck muscles (spasmodic torticollis) and spasms of the hand and finger muscles (writer's cramp). researchers suspect that benign essential blepharospasm and similar forms of dystonia are associated with malfunction of the basal ganglia, which are structures deep within the brain that help start and control movement. although genetic factors are almost certainly involved in benign essential blepharospasm, no genes have been clearly associated with the condition. several studies have looked at the relationship between common variations (polymorphisms) in the drd5 and tor1a genes and the risk of developing benign essential blepharospasm. these studies have had conflicting results, with some showing an association and others finding no connection. researchers are working to determine which genetic factors are related to this disorder."
what is (are) hennekam syndrome ?,"hennekam syndrome is an inherited disorder resulting from malformation of the lymphatic system, which is part of both the circulatory system and immune system. the lymphatic system consists of a network of vessels that transport lymph fluid and immune cells throughout the body. the characteristic signs and symptoms of hennekam syndrome are lymphatic vessels that are abnormally expanded (lymphangiectasia), particularly the vessels that transport lymph fluid to and from the intestines; puffiness or swelling caused by a buildup of fluid (lymphedema); and unusual facial features. lymphangiectasia often impedes the flow of lymph fluid and can cause the affected vessels to break open (rupture). in the intestines, ruptured vessels can lead to accumulation of lymph fluid, which interferes with the absorption of nutrients, fats, and proteins. accumulation of lymph fluid in the abdomen can cause swelling (chylous ascites). lymphangiectasia can also affect the kidneys, thyroid gland, the outer covering of the lungs (the pleura), the membrane covering the heart (pericardium), or the skin. the lymphedema in hennekam syndrome is often noticeable at birth and usually affects the face and limbs. severely affected infants may have extensive swelling caused by fluid accumulation before birth (hydrops fetalis). the lymphedema usually affects one side of the body more severely than the other (asymmetric) and slowly worsens over time. facial features of people with hennekam syndrome may include a flattened appearance to the middle of the face and the bridge of the nose, puffy eyelids, widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), small ears, and a small mouth with overgrowth of the gums (gingival hypertrophy). affected individuals may also have an unusually small head (microcephaly) and premature fusion of the skull bones (craniosynostosis). individuals with hennekam syndrome often have intellectual disability that ranges from mild to severe, although most are on the mild end of the range and some have normal intellect. many individuals with hennekam syndrome have growth delay, respiratory problems, permanently bent fingers and toes (camptodactyly), or fusion of the skin between the fingers and toes (cutaneous syndactyly). abnormalities found in a few individuals with hennekam syndrome include a moderate to severe shortage of red blood cells (anemia) resulting from an inadequate amount (deficiency) of iron in the bloodstream, multiple spleens (polysplenia), misplaced kidneys, genital anomalies, a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (umbilical hernia), heart abnormalities, hearing loss, excessive body hair growth (hirsutism), a narrow upper chest that may have a sunken appearance (pectus excavatum), an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis), and inward- and upward-turning feet (clubfeet). the signs and symptoms of hennekam syndrome vary widely among affected individuals, even those within the same family. life expectancy depends on the severity of the condition and can vary from death in childhood to survival into adulthood."

is russell-silver syndrome inherited ?,"most cases of russell-silver syndrome are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. less commonly, russell-silver syndrome can run in families. in some affected families, the condition appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of a genetic change in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in other families, the condition has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of a gene are altered in each cell. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what are the genetic changes related to gillespie syndrome ?,"gillespie syndrome can be caused by mutations in the pax6 gene. the pax6 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in early development, including the development of the eyes and brain. the pax6 protein attaches (binds) to specific regions of dna and regulates the activity of other genes. on the basis of this role, the pax6 protein is called a transcription factor. mutations in the pax6 gene result in the absence of the pax6 protein or production of a nonfunctional pax6 protein that is unable to bind to dna and regulate the activity of other genes. this lack of functional protein disrupts embryonic development, especially the development of the eyes and brain, leading to the signs and symptoms of gillespie syndrome. most people with gillespie syndrome do not have mutations in the pax6 gene. in these affected individuals, the cause of the disorder is unknown."

what are the genetic changes related to gilbert syndrome ?,"changes in the ugt1a1 gene cause gilbert syndrome. this gene provides instructions for making the bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (bilirubin-ugt) enzyme, which is found primarily in liver cells and is necessary for the removal of bilirubin from the body. the bilirubin-ugt enzyme performs a chemical reaction called glucuronidation. during this reaction, the enzyme transfers a compound called glucuronic acid to unconjugated bilirubin, converting it to conjugated bilirubin. glucuronidation makes bilirubin dissolvable in water so that it can be removed from the body. gilbert syndrome occurs worldwide, but some mutations occur more often in particular populations. in many populations, the most common genetic change that causes gilbert syndrome (known as ugt1a1*28) occurs in an area near the ugt1a1 gene called the promoter region, which controls the production of the bilirubin-ugt enzyme. this genetic change impairs enzyme production. however, this change is uncommon in asian populations, and affected asians often have a mutation that changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the bilirubin-ugt enzyme. this type of mutation, known as a missense mutation, results in reduced enzyme function. people with gilbert syndrome have approximately 30 percent of normal bilirubin-ugt enzyme function. as a result, unconjugated bilirubin is not glucuronidated quickly enough. this toxic substance then builds up in the body, causing mild hyperbilirubinemia. not everyone with the genetic changes that cause gilbert syndrome develops hyperbilirubinemia, indicating that additional factors, such as conditions that further hinder the glucuronidation process, may be necessary for development of the condition. for example, red blood cells may break down too easily, releasing excess amounts of bilirubin that the impaired enzyme cannot keep up with. alternatively, movement of bilirubin into the liver, where it would be glucuronidated, may be impaired. these other factors may be due to changes in other genes."
how many people are affected by mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency ?,mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency is a rare disorder; its incidence is unknown.
what are the genetic changes related to mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency ?,"mutations in the hadha and hadhb genes cause mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency. these genes each provide instructions for making part of an enzyme complex called mitochondrial trifunctional protein. this enzyme complex functions in mitochondria, the energy-producing centers within cells. as the name suggests, mitochondrial trifunctional protein contains three enzymes that each perform a different function. this enzyme complex is required to break down (metabolize) a group of fats called long-chain fatty acids. long-chain fatty acids are found in foods such as milk and certain oils. these fatty acids are stored in the body's fat tissues. fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. during periods of fasting, fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues. mutations in the hadha or hadhb genes that cause mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency disrupt all three functions of this enzyme complex. without enough of this enzyme complex, long-chain fatty acids from food and body fat cannot be metabolized and processed. as a result, these fatty acids are not converted to energy, which can lead to some features of this disorder, such as lethargy and hypoglycemia. long-chain fatty acids or partially metabolized fatty acids may also build up and damage the liver, heart, and muscles. this abnormal buildup causes the other signs and symptoms of mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency."
what is (are) urinary incontinence in children ?,"urinary incontinence is the loss of bladder control, which results in the accidental loss of urine. a child with ui may not stay dry during the day or night. some ui is caused by a health problem such as - a urinary tract infection (uti) - diabetes, a condition where blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high - kidney problems - nerve problems - constipation, a condition in which a child has fewer than two bowel movements a week and stools can be hard, dry, small, and difficult to pass - obstructive sleep apnea (osa), a condition in which breathing is interrupted during sleep, often because of inflamed or enlarged tonsils - a structural problem in the urinary tract most of the time, the exact cause of ui is not known, but it is often the result of more than one factor. although ui affects many children, it usually disappears naturally over time. ui after age 3the age when most children achieve daytime drynessmay cause great distress and embarrassment. many children experience occasional ui, and treatment is available for most children who have a hard time controlling their bladder. thus, caregivers of children who wet the bed or have accidents during the day should approach this problem with understanding and patience. the age at which children achieve dryness varies. wetting in younger children is common and not considered ui, so daytime ui is not usually diagnosed until age 5 or 6, and nighttime ui is not usually diagnosed until age 7. enuresis urinary incontinence is also called enuresis. types of enuresis include the following: - primary enuresis is wetting in a child who has never been consistently dry. - secondary enuresis is wetting that begins after at least 6 months of dryness. - nocturnal enuresis is wetting that usually occurs during sleep, also called nighttime ui. - diurnal enuresis is wetting when awake, also called daytime ui."
what causes hemochromatosis ?,"primary hemochromatosis inherited genetic defects cause primary hemochromatosis, and mutations in the hfe gene are associated with up to 90 percent of cases.1 the hfe gene helps regulate the amount of iron absorbed from food. the two known mutations of hfe are c282y and h63d. c282y defects are the most common cause of primary hemochromatosis. people inherit two copies of the hfe geneone copy from each parent. most people who inherit two copies of the hfe gene with the c282y defect will have higher-than-average iron absorption. however, not all of these people will develop health problems associated with hemochromatosis. one recent study found that 31 percent of people with two copies of the c282y defect developed health problems by their early fifties.2 men who develop health problems from hfe defects typically develop them after age 40.1 women who develop health problems from hfe defects typically develop them after menopause.1 people who inherit two h63d defects or one c282y and one h63d defect may have higher-than-average iron absorption.3 however, they are unlikely to develop iron overload and organ damage. rare defects in other genes may also cause primary hemochromatosis. mutations in the hemojuvelin or hepcidin genes cause juvenile hemochromatosis, a type of primary hemochromatosis. people with juvenile hemochromatosis typically develop severe iron overload and liver and heart damage between ages 15 and 30. secondary hemochromatosis hemochromatosis that is not inherited is called secondary hemochromatosis. the most common cause of secondary hemochromatosis is frequent blood transfusions in people with severe anemia. anemia is a condition in which red blood cells are fewer or smaller than normal, which means they carry less oxygen to the bodys cells. types of anemia that may require frequent blood transfusions include - congenital, or inherited, anemias such as sickle cell disease, thalassemia, and fanconis syndrome - severe acquired anemias, which are not inherited, such as aplastic anemia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia liver diseasessuch as alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and chronic hepatitis c infectionmay cause mild iron overload. however, this iron overload causes much less liver damage than the underlying liver disease causes. neonatal hemochromatosis neonatal hemochromatosis is a rare disease characterized by liver failure and death in fetuses and newborns. researchers are studying the causes of neonatal hemochromatosis and believe more than one factor may lead to the disease. experts previously considered neonatal hemochromatosis a type of primary hemochromatosis. however, recent studies suggest genetic defects that increase iron absorption do not cause this disease. instead, the mothers immune system may produce antibodiesproteins made by the immune system to protect the body from foreign substances such as bacteria or virusesthat damage the liver of the fetus. women who have had one child with neonatal hemochromatosis are at risk for having more children with the disease.4 treating these women during pregnancy with intravenous (iv) immunoglobulina solution of antibodies from healthy peoplecan prevent fetal liver damage.4 researchers supported by the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases (niddk) recently found that a combination of exchange transfusionremoving blood and replacing it with donor bloodand iv immunoglobulin is an effective treatment for babies born with neonatal hemochromatosis.5"
what to do for hemochromatosis ?,"iron is an essential nutrient found in many foods. healthy people usually absorb less than 10 percent of iron in the food they eat.6 people with hemochromatosis absorb up to 30 percent of that iron.6 people with hemochromatosis can help prevent iron overload by - eating only moderate amounts of iron-rich foods, such as red meat and organ meat - avoiding supplements that contain iron - avoiding supplements that contain vitamin c, which increases iron absorption people with hemochromatosis can take steps to help prevent liver damage, including - limiting the amount of alcoholic beverages they drink because alcohol increases their chance of cirrhosis and liver cancer - avoiding alcoholic beverages entirely if they already have cirrhosis"
what to do for hemochromatosis ?,"- hemochromatosis is the most common form of iron overload disease. too much iron in the body causes hemochromatosis. - inherited genetic defects cause primary hemochromatosis. - primary hemochromatosis mainly affects caucasians of northern european descent. - a person with hemochromatosis may notice one or more of the following symptoms: joint pain; fatigue, or feeling tired; unexplained weight loss; abnormal bronze or gray skin color; abdominal pain; and loss of sex drive. not everyone with hemochromatosis will develop these symptoms. - without treatment, iron may build up in the organs and cause complications, including cirrhosis, diabetes, irregular heart rhythms or weakening of the heart muscle, arthritis, and erectile dysfunction. - if a health care provider diagnoses and treats the iron overload caused by hemochromatosis before organ damage has occurred, a person can live a normal, healthy life. - experts recommend testing for hemochromatosis in people who have symptoms, complications, or a family history of the disease. - health care providers treat hemochromatosis by drawing blood. this process is called phlebotomy."
what are the complications of ulcerative colitis ?,"complications of ulcerative colitis can include - rectal bleedingwhen ulcers in the intestinal lining open and bleed. rectal bleeding can cause anemia, which health care providers can treat with diet changes and iron supplements. people who have a large amount of bleeding in the intestine over a short period of time may require surgery to stop the bleeding. severe bleeding is a rare complication of ulcerative colitis. - dehydration and malabsorbtion, which occur when the large intestine is unable to absorb fluids and nutrients because of diarrhea and inflammation. some people may need iv fluids to replace lost nutrients and fluids. - changes in bones. some corticosteroid medications taken to treat ulcerative colitis symptoms can cause - osteoporosisthe loss of bone - osteopenialow bone density health care providers will monitor people for bone loss and can recommend calcium and vitamin d supplements and medications to help prevent or slow bone loss. - inflammation in other areas of the body. the immune system can trigger inflammation in the - joints - eyes - skin - liver health care providers can treat inflammation by adjusting medications or prescribing new medications. - megacolona serious complication that occurs when inflammation spreads to the deep tissue layers of the large intestine. the large intestine swells and stops working. megacolon can be a life-threatening complication and most often requires surgery. megacolon is a rare complication of ulcerative colitis. ulcerative colitis and colon cancer people with ulcerative colitis may be more likely to develop colon cancer when - ulcerative colitis affects the entire colon - a person has ulcerative colitis for at least 8 years - inflammation is ongoing - people also have primary sclerosing cholangitis, a condition that affects the liver - a person is male people who receive ongoing treatment and remain in remission may reduce their chances of developing colon cancer. people with ulcerative colitis should talk with their health care provider about how often they should get screened for colon cancer. screening can include colonoscopy with biopsies or a special dye spray called chromoendoscopy. health care providers may recommend colonoscopy every 1 to 3 years for people with ulcerative colitis who have - the disease in one-third or more or of their colon - had ulcerative colitis for 8 years such screening does not reduce a person's chances of developing colon cancer. instead, screening can help diagnose cancer early and improve chances for recovery. surgery to remove the entire colon eliminates the risk of colon cancer."
how to diagnose what i need to know about cirrhosis ?,"your doctor will examine you and may perform - blood tests to see whether your liver is working properly - imaging tests, which may show the size of your liver and show swelling or shrinkage - a liver biopsy, in which a doctor uses a needle to take a small piece of liver tissue to view with a microscope to look for scar tissue"
what are the treatments for growth failure in children with chronic kidney disease ?,"health care providers treat growth failure in children with ckd with - changes in eating, diet, and nutrition - medications - growth hormone therapy most children with growth failure grow to about one-third of their adult height within the first two years of life; therefore, it is important to start treatment for growth failure early.1"
what are the treatments for analgesic nephropathy (painkillers and the kidneys) ?,"if you have been taking analgesics regularly to control chronic pain, you may be advised to find new ways to treat your pain, such as behavior modification or relaxation techniques. depending on how much your kidney function has declined, you may be advised to change your diet, limit the fluids you drink, or take medications to avoid anemia and bone problems caused by kidney disease. your doctor will monitor your kidney function with regular urine and blood tests."
what to do for what i need to know about physical activity and diabetes ?,"- starting a physical activity program can help you lose weight or keep a healthy weight and keep your blood glucose levels on target. - always talk with your health care team before you start a new physical activity program. - ask your health care team if you need to change the amount of medicine you take or the food you eat before any physical activity. - talk with your health care team about what types of physical activity are safe for you, such as walking, weightlifting, or housework. - to make sure you stay active, find activities you like to do. ask a friend or family member to be your exercise buddy. - write down your blood glucose levels and when and how long you are physically active in a record book. - doctors suggest that you aim for 30 to 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity most days of the week. - children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes who are 10 to 17 years old should aim for 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity every day. - not all physical activity has to take place at the same time. for example, you might take a walk for 20 minutes, lift hand weights for 10 minutes, and walk up and down the stairs for 5 minutes. - doing moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise for 30 to 60 minutes a day most days of the week provides many benefits. you can even split up these minutes into several parts. - start exercising slowly, with 5 to 10 minutes a day, and add a little more time each week. try walking briskly, hiking, or climbing stairs. - whether youre a man or a woman, you can do strength training with hand weights, elastic bands, or weight machines two to three times a week. - stretching exercises are a light to moderate physical activity that both men and women can do. when you stretch, you increase your flexibility, lower your stress, and help prevent sore muscles. - increase daily activity by spending less time watching tv or at the computer. - try these simple ways to add light, moderate, or vigorous physical activities in your life every day: - walk around while you talk on the phone. - take a walk through your neighborhood. - do chores, such as work in the garden or rake leaves, clean the house, or wash the car. - if you have type 1 diabetes, try not to do vigorous physical activity when you have ketones in your blood or urine."
what is (are) pyelonephritis: kidney infection ?,pyelonephritis is a type of urinary tract infection (uti) that affects one or both kidneys.
what is (are) pyelonephritis: kidney infection ?,"the urinary tract is the bodys drainage system for removing wastes and extra water. the urinary tract includes two kidneys, two ureters, a bladder, and a urethra. the kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. they are located near the middle of the back, just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. every day, the two kidneys process about 200 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra water. children produce less urine than adults. the amount produced depends on their age. the urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called the ureters. the bladder stores urine until releasing it through urination. when the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra at the bottom of the bladder."
what is (are) kidney failure: eat right to feel right on hemodialysis ?,"you already know you need to watch how much you drink. any food that is liquid at room temperature also contains water. these foods include soup, jell-o, and ice cream. many fruits and vegetables contain lots of water, too. they include melons, grapes, apples, oranges, tomatoes, lettuce, and celery. all these foods add to your fluid intake. fluid can build up between dialysis sessions, causing swelling and weight gain. the extra fluid affects your blood pressure and can make your heart work harder. you could have serious heart trouble from overloading your system with fluid. control your thirst the best way to reduce fluid intake is to reduce thirst caused by the salt you eat. avoid salty foods like chips and pretzels. choose low-sodium products. you can keep your fluids down by drinking from smaller cups or glasses. freeze juice in an ice cube tray and eat it like a popsicle. (remember to count the popsicle in your fluid allowance!) the dietitian will be able to give you other tips for managing your thirst. your dry weight is your weight after a dialysis session when all of the extra fluid in your body has been removed. if you let too much fluid build up between sessions, it is harder to get down to your proper dry weight. your dry weight may change over a period of 3 to 6 weeks. talk with your doctor regularly about what your dry weight should be. my dry weight should be _____________. talk with a dietitian even though you are on hemodialysis, your kidneys may still be able to remove some fluid. or your kidneys may not remove any fluid at all. that is why every patient has a different daily allowance for fluid. talk with your dietitian about how much fluid you can have each day. i can have _____ ounces of fluid each day. plan 1 day of fluid servings: i can have _____ ounce(s) of ______________ with breakfast. i can have _____ ounce(s) of ______________ in the morning. i can have _____ ounce(s) of ______________ with lunch. i can have _____ ounce(s) of ______________ in the afternoon. i can have _____ ounce(s) of ______________ with supper. i can have _____ ounce(s) of ______________ in the evening. total _______ ounces (should equal the allowance written above)"
what is (are) kidney failure: eat right to feel right on hemodialysis ?,"potassium is a mineral found in many foods, especially milk, fruits, and vegetables. it affects how steadily your heart beats. healthy kidneys keep the right amount of potassium in the blood to keep the heart beating at a steady pace. potassium levels can rise between dialysis sessions and affect your heartbeat. eating too much potassium can be very dangerous to your heart. it may even cause death. to control potassium levels in your blood, avoid foods like avocados, bananas, kiwis, and dried fruit, which are very high in potassium. also, eat smaller portions of other high-potassium foods. for example, eat half a pear instead of a whole pear. eat only very small portions of oranges and melons. dicing and boiling potatoes to reduce potassium you can remove some of the potassium from potatoes by dicing or shredding them and then boiling them in water. your dietitian will give you more specific information about the potassium content of foods. talk with a dietitian make a food plan that reduces the potassium in your diet. start by noting the high-potassium foods (below) that you now eat. a dietitian can help you add other foods to the list. high-potassium foods apricots avocados bananas beets brussels sprouts cantaloupe clams dates figs kiwi fruit lima beans melons milk nectarines orange juice oranges peanuts pears (fresh) potatoes prune juice prunes raisins sardines spinach tomatoes winter squash yogurt others:______________________________________ changes: talk with a dietitian about foods you can eat instead of high-potassium foods. instead of _________, i will eat _________. instead of _________, i will eat _________. instead of _________, i will eat _________. instead of _________, i will eat _________."
what is (are) kidney failure: eat right to feel right on hemodialysis ?,"phosphorus is a mineral found in many foods. if you have too much phosphorus in your blood, it pulls calcium from your bones. losing calcium will make your bones weak and likely to break. also, too much phosphorus may make your skin itch. foods like milk and cheese, dried beans, peas, colas, nuts, and peanut butter are high in phosphorus. usually, people on dialysis are limited to 1/2 cup of milk per day. the renal dietitian will give you more specific information regarding phosphorus. you probably will need to take a phosphate binder like renagel, phoslo, tums, or calcium carbonate to control the phosphorus in your blood between dialysis sessions. these medications act like sponges to soak up, or bind, phosphorus while it is in the stomach. because it is bound, the phosphorus does not get into the blood. instead, it is passed out of the body in the stool."
what is (are) kidney failure: eat right to feel right on hemodialysis ?,"before you were on dialysis, your doctor may have told you to follow a low-protein diet. being on dialysis changes this. most people on dialysis are encouraged to eat as much high-quality protein as they can. protein helps you keep muscle and repair tissue. the better nourished you are, the healthier you will be. you will also have greater resistance to infection and recover from surgery more quickly. your body breaks protein down into a waste product called urea. if urea builds up in your blood, it's a sign you have become very sick. eating mostly high-quality proteins is important because they produce less waste than others. high-quality proteins come from meat, fish, poultry, and eggs (especially egg whites). talk with a dietitian meat, fish, and chicken are good sources of protein. talk with a dietitian about the meats you eat. i will eat ______ servings of meat each day. a regular serving size is 3 ounces. this is about the size of the palm of your hand or a deck of cards. try to choose lean (low-fat) meats that are also low in phosphorus. if you are a vegetarian, ask about other ways to get your protein. low-fat milk is a good source of protein. but milk is high in phosphorus and potassium. and milk adds to your fluid intake. talk with a dietitian to see if milk fits into your food plan. i (will) (will not) drink milk. i will drink ______ cup(s) of milk a day."

what are the symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and addison's disease ?,"adrenal insufficiency the most common symptoms of adrenal insufficiency are - chronic, or long lasting, fatigue - muscle weakness - loss of appetite - weight loss - abdominal pain other symptoms of adrenal insufficiency can include - nausea - vomiting - diarrhea - low blood pressure that drops further when a person stands up, causing dizziness or fainting - irritability and depression - craving salty foods - hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar - headache - sweating - irregular or absent menstrual periods - in women, loss of interest in sex hyperpigmentation, or darkening of the skin, can occur in addisons disease, although not in secondary adrenal insufficiency. this darkening is most visible on scars; skin folds; pressure points such as the elbows, knees, knuckles, and toes; lips; and mucous membranes such as the lining of the cheek. the slowly progressing symptoms of adrenal insufficiency are often ignored until a stressful event, such as surgery, a severe injury, an illness, or pregnancy, causes them to worsen. adrenal crisis sudden, severe worsening of adrenal insufficiency symptoms is called adrenal crisis. if the person has addisons disease, this worsening can also be called an addisonian crisis. in most cases, symptoms of adrenal insufficiency become serious enough that people seek medical treatment before an adrenal crisis occurs. however, sometimes symptoms appear for the first time during an adrenal crisis. symptoms of adrenal crisis include - sudden, severe pain in the lower back, abdomen, or legs - severe vomiting and diarrhea - dehydration - low blood pressure - loss of consciousness if not treated, an adrenal crisis can cause death. get treatment for adrenal crisis right away people with adrenal insufficiency who have weakness, nausea, or vomiting need immediate emergency treatment to prevent an adrenal crisis and possible death. an injection with a synthetic glucocorticoid hormone called a corticosteroid can save a persons life. people should make sure to have a corticosteroid injection with them at all times, and make sure their friends and family know how and when to give the injection. read more under how is adrenal insufficiency treated?"
what causes adrenal insufficiency and addison's disease ?,"autoimmune disorders cause most cases of addisons disease. infections and medications may also cause the disease. autoimmune disorders up to 80 percent of addisons disease cases are caused by an autoimmune disorder, which is when the bodys immune system attacks the bodys own cells and organs.2 in autoimmune addisons, which mainly occurs in middle-aged females, the immune system gradually destroys the adrenal cortexthe outer layer of the adrenal glands.2 primary adrenal insufficiency occurs when at least 90 percent of the adrenal cortex has been destroyed.1 as a result, both cortisol and aldosterone are often lacking. sometimes only the adrenal glands are affected. sometimes other endocrine glands are affected as well, as in polyendocrine deficiency syndrome. polyendocrine deficiency syndrome is classified into type 1 and type 2. type 1 is inherited and occurs in children. in addition to adrenal insufficiency, these children may have - underactive parathyroid glands, which are four pea-sized glands located on or near the thyroid gland in the neck; they produce a hormone that helps maintain the correct balance of calcium in the body. - slow sexual development. - pernicious anemia, a severe type of anemia; anemia is a condition in which red blood cells are fewer than normal, which means less oxygen is carried to the bodys cells. with most types of anemia, red blood cells are smaller than normal; however, in pernicious anemia, the cells are bigger than normal. - chronic fungal infections. - chronic hepatitis, a liver disease. researchers think type 2, which is sometimes called schmidts syndrome, is also inherited. type 2 usually affects young adults and may include - an underactive thyroid gland, which produces hormones that regulate metabolism - slow sexual development - diabetes, in which a person has high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia - vitiligo, a loss of pigment on areas of the skin infections tuberculosis (tb), an infection that can destroy the adrenal glands, accounts for 10 to 15 percent of addisons disease cases in developed countries.1 when primary adrenal insufficiency was first identified by dr. thomas addison in 1849, tb was the most common cause of the disease. as tb treatment improved, the incidence of addisons disease due to tb of the adrenal glands greatly decreased. however, recent reports show an increase in addisons disease from infections such as tb and cytomegalovirus. cytomegalovirus is a common virus that does not cause symptoms in healthy people; however, it does affect babies in the womb and people who have a weakened immune systemmostly due to hiv/aids.2 other bacterial infections, such as neisseria meningitidis, which is a cause of meningitis, and fungal infections can also lead to addisons disease. other causes less common causes of addisons disease are - cancer cells in the adrenal glands - amyloidosis, a serious, though rare, group of diseases that occurs when abnormal proteins, called amyloids, build up in the blood and are deposited in tissues and organs - surgical removal of the adrenal glands - bleeding into the adrenal glands - genetic defects including abnormal adrenal gland development, an inability of the adrenal glands to respond to acth, or a defect in adrenal hormone production - medication-related causes, such as from anti-fungal medications and the anesthetic etomidate, which may be used when a person undergoes an emergency intubationthe placement of a flexible, plastic tube through the mouth and into the trachea, or windpipe, to assist with breathing 2"
what causes adrenal insufficiency and addison's disease ?,"a lack of crh or acth causes secondary adrenal insufficiency. the lack of these hormones in the body can be traced to several possible sources. stoppage of corticosteroid medication a temporary form of secondary adrenal insufficiency may occur when a person who has been taking a synthetic glucocorticoid hormone, called a corticosteroid, for a long time stops taking the medication. corticosteroids are often prescribed to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and ulcerative colitis. in this case, the prescription doses often cause higher levels than those normally achieved by the glucocorticoid hormones created by the body. when a person takes corticosteroids for prolonged periods, the adrenal glands produce less of their natural hormones. once the prescription doses of corticosteroid are stopped, the adrenal glands may be slow to restart their production of the bodys glucocorticoids. to give the adrenal glands time to regain function and prevent adrenal insufficiency, prescription corticosteroid doses should be reduced gradually over a period of weeks or even months. even with gradual reduction, the adrenal glands might not begin to function normally for some time, so a person who has recently stopped taking prescription corticosteroids should be watched carefully for symptoms of secondary adrenal insufficiency. surgical removal of pituitary tumors another cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency is surgical removal of the usually noncancerous, acth-producing tumors of the pituitary gland that cause cushings syndrome. cushings syndrome is a hormonal disorder caused by prolonged exposure of the bodys tissues to high levels of the hormone cortisol. when the tumors are removed, the source of extra acth is suddenly gone and a replacement hormone must be taken until the bodys adrenal glands are able to resume their normal production of cortisol. the adrenal glands might not begin to function normally for some time, so a person who has had an acth-producing tumor removed and is going off of his or her prescription corticosteroid replacement hormone should be watched carefully for symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, cushings syndrome. changes in the pituitary gland less commonly, secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs when the pituitary gland either decreases in size or stops producing acth. these events can result from - tumors or an infection in the pituitary - loss of blood flow to the pituitary - radiation for the treatment of pituitary or nearby tumors - surgical removal of parts of the hypothalamus - surgical removal of the pituitary"
what are the treatments for celiac disease ?,"most people with celiac disease have a significant improvement in symptoms when they follow a gluten-free diet. health care providers typically refer people to a dietitian who specializes in treating people with the disease. the dietitian will teach the person to avoid gluten while following a healthy and nutritious diet. the dietitian will give the person instructions for how to - read food and product labels and identify ingredients that contain gluten - make healthy choices about the types of foods to eat - design everyday meal plans for most people, following a gluten-free diet will stop symptoms, heal existing intestinal damage, and prevent further damage. symptoms may improve within days to weeks of starting the diet. the small intestine usually heals in 3 to 6 months in children. complete healing can take several years in adults. once the intestine heals, the villi will absorb nutrients from food into the bloodstream normally. some people with celiac disease show no improvement after starting a gluten-free diet. the most common reason for poor response to dietary changes is that people are still consuming small amounts of gluten, which can damage the small intestineeven in people without symptoms. most people start responding to the gluten-free diet once they find and eliminate hidden sources of gluten from their diet. hidden sources of gluten include additives made with wheat, such as - modified food starch - preservatives - stabilizers did you know that medications and nonfood products may contain gluten? medications, supplements, and other products may also contain lecithin, a hidden source of gluten. people with celiac disease should ask a pharmacist about the ingredients in - prescription and over-the-counter medications - vitamins and mineral supplements - herbal and nutritional supplements other products can be ingested or transferred from a person's hands to his or her mouth. reading product labels can help people avoid gluten exposure. if a product's label does not list its ingredients, the manufacturer should provide a list upon request. products that can contain gluten include - lipstick, lip gloss, and lip balm - cosmetics - skin and hair products - toothpaste and mouthwash - glue on stamps and envelopes - children's modeling dough, such as play-doh some people who continue to have symptoms even after changing their diet may have other conditions or disorders that are more common in people with celiac disease. these conditions may include - small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, which happens when too many bacteria grow in the small intestine - pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, in which the pancreas does not produce enough digestive juice - microscopic colitis, an inflammation of the colon that a health care provider can see only with a microscope - ibs - lactose intolerance, a condition in which people have symptoms after consuming milk or milk products - other food intolerances, which may occur because of continued damage to the intestine in some cases, people continue to have difficulty absorbing nutrients despite following a strict gluten-free diet. people with this condition, known as refractory celiac disease, have severely damaged intestines that cannot heal. their intestines are not absorbing enough nutrients, so they may need to receive nutrients intravenously. researchers continue to evaluate medications to treat refractory celiac disease. depending on a person's age at diagnosis, some complications of celiac disease will not improve, such as short stature and dental enamel defects. for people with dermatitis herpetiformis, skin symptoms generally respond to a gluten-free diet and may recur if a person adds gluten back into his or her diet. medications such as dapsone can control the rash's symptoms. dapsone does not treat intestinal symptoms or damage, so people with dermatitis herpetiformis should maintain a gluten-free diet, even if they don't have digestive symptoms. even when a person follows a gluten-free diet, the skin lesions from dermatitis herpetiformis may take months or even years to fully heal and often recur over the years."
what are the treatments for treatment methods for kidney failure: hemodialysis ?,"your kidneys do much more than remove wastes and extra fluid. they also make hormones and balance chemicals in your system. when your kidneys stop working, you may have problems with anemia and conditions that affect your bones, nerves, and skin. some of the more common conditions caused by kidney failure are extreme tiredness, bone problems, joint problems, itching, and ""restless legs."" restless legs will keep you awake as you feel them twitching and jumping. anemia and erythropoietin (epo) anemia is a condition in which the volume of red blood cells is low. red blood cells carry oxygen to cells throughout the body. without oxygen, cells can't use the energy from food, so someone with anemia may tire easily and look pale. anemia can also contribute to heart problems. anemia is common in people with kidney disease because the kidneys produce the hormone erythropoietin, or epo, which stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. diseased kidneys often don't make enough epo, and so the bone marrow makes fewer red blood cells. epo is available commercially and is commonly given to patients on dialysis. for more information about the causes of and treatments for anemia in kidney failure, see the niddk fact sheet anemia in chronic kidney disease. renal osteodystrophy the term ""renal"" describes things related to the kidneys. renal osteodystrophy, or bone disease of kidney failure, affects 90 percent of dialysis patients. it causes bones to become thin and weak or formed incorrectly and affects both children and adults. symptoms can be seen in growing children with kidney disease even before they start dialysis. older patients and women who have gone through menopause are at greater risk for this disease. for more information about the causes of this bone disease and its treatment in dialysis patients, see the niddk fact sheet chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder. itching (pruritus) many people treated with hemodialysis complain of itchy skin, which is often worse during or just after treatment. itching is common even in people who don't have kidney disease; in kidney failure, however, itching can be made worse by wastes in the bloodstream that current dialyzer membranes can't remove from the blood. the problem can also be related to high levels of parathyroid hormone (pth). some people have found dramatic relief after having their parathyroid glands removed. the four parathyroid glands sit on the outer surface of the thyroid gland, which is located on the windpipe in the base of your neck, just above the collarbone. the parathyroid glands help control the levels of calcium and phosphorus in the blood. but a cure for itching that works for everyone has not been found. phosphate binders seem to help some people; these medications act like sponges to soak up, or bind, phosphorus while it is in the stomach. others find relief after exposure to ultraviolet light. still others improve with epo shots. a few antihistamines (benadryl, atarax, vistaril) have been found to help; also, capsaicin cream applied to the skin may relieve itching by deadening nerve impulses. in any case, taking care of dry skin is important. applying creams with lanolin or camphor may help. sleep disorders patients on dialysis often have insomnia, and some people have a specific problem called the sleep apnea syndrome, which is often signaled by snoring and breaks in snoring. episodes of apnea are actually breaks in breathing during sleep. over time, these sleep disturbances can lead to ""day-night reversal"" (insomnia at night, sleepiness during the day), headache, depression, and decreased alertness. the apnea may be related to the effects of advanced kidney failure on the control of breathing. treatments that work with people who have sleep apnea, whether they have kidney failure or not, include losing weight, changing sleeping position, and wearing a mask that gently pumps air continuously into the nose (nasal continuous positive airway pressure, or cpap). many people on dialysis have trouble sleeping at night because of aching, uncomfortable, jittery, or ""restless"" legs. you may feel a strong impulse to kick or thrash your legs. kicking may occur during sleep and disturb a bed partner throughout the night. the causes of restless legs may include nerve damage or chemical imbalances. moderate exercise during the day may help, but exercising a few hours before bedtime can make it worse. people with restless leg syndrome should reduce or avoid caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco; some people also find relief with massages or warm baths. a class of drugs called benzodiazepines, often used to treat insomnia or anxiety, may help as well. these prescription drugs include klonopin, librium, valium, and halcion. a newer and sometimes more effective therapy is levodopa (sinemet), a drug used to treat parkinson's disease. sleep disorders may seem unimportant, but they can impair your quality of life. don't hesitate to raise these problems with your nurse, doctor, or social worker. amyloidosis dialysis-related amyloidosis (dra) is common in people who have been on dialysis for more than 5 years. dra develops when proteins in the blood deposit on joints and tendons, causing pain, stiffness, and fluid in the joints, as is the case with arthritis. working kidneys filter out these proteins, but dialysis filters are not as effective. for more information, see the niddk fact sheet amyloidosis and kidney disease."
what are the symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis ?,"the most common symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis are - fatigue - joint pain - nausea - loss of appetite - pain or discomfort over the liver - skin rashes - dark yellow urine - light-colored stools - jaundice, or yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis range from mild to severe. some people may feel as if they have a mild case of the flu. others may have no symptoms when a health care provider diagnoses the disease; however, they can develop symptoms later."
what are the treatments for whipple disease ?,"the health care provider prescribes antibiotics to destroy the t. whipplei bacteria and treat whipple disease. health care providers choose antibiotics that treat the infection in the small intestine and cross the blood-brain barriera layer of tissue around the brain. using antibiotics that cross the blood-brain barrier ensures destruction of any bacteria that may have entered the patients brain and central nervous system. the health care provider usually prescribes iv antibiotics for the first 2 weeks of treatment. most patients feel relief from symptoms within the first week or two. a nurse or technician places an iv in the patients arm to give the antibiotics. iv antibiotics used to treat whipple disease may include - ceftriaxone (rocephin) - meropenem (merrem i.v.) - penicillin g (pfizerpen) - streptomycin (streptomycin) after a patient completes the iv antibiotics, the health care provider will prescribe long-term oral antibiotics. patients receive long-term treatmentat least 1 to 2 yearsto cure the infection anywhere in the body. oral antibiotics may include - trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (septra, bactrim)a combination antibiotic - doxycycline (vibramycin) patients should finish the prescribed course of antibiotics to ensure the medication destroyed all t. whipplei bacteria in the body. patients who feel better may still have the bacteria in the small intestine or other areas of the body for 1 to 2 years. a health care provider will monitor the patient closely, repeat the blood tests, and repeat the upper gi endoscopy with biopsy during and after treatment to determine whether t. whipplei is still present. people may relapse during or after treatment. a health care provider will prescribe additional or new antibiotics if a relapse occurs. some people will relapse years after treatment, so it is important for patients to schedule routine follow-ups with the health care provider. most patients have good outcomes with an early diagnosis and complete treatment. health care providers treat patients with neurologic symptoms at diagnosis or during relapse more aggressively. treatment may include - a combination of antibiotics - hydroxychloroquine (plaquenil)an antimalarial medication - weekly injections of interferon gammaa substance made by the body that activates the immune system - corticosteroidsmedications that decrease inflammation"
what are the symptoms of intestinal pseudo-obstruction ?,"intestinal pseudo-obstruction symptoms may include - abdominal swelling or bloating, also called distension - abdominal pain - nausea - vomiting - constipation - diarrhea over time, the condition can cause malnutrition, bacterial overgrowth in the intestines, and weight loss. malnutrition is a condition that develops when the body does not get the right amount of the vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ function. some people develop problems with their esophagus, stomach, or bladder."
what are the treatments for what i need to know about erectile dysfunction ?,"your doctor can offer you a number of treatments for ed. for many men, the answer is as simple as taking a pill. other men have to try two or three options before they find a treatment that works for them. dont give up if the first treatment doesnt work. finding the right treatment can take time. you may want to talk with your sexual partner about which treatment fits you best as a couple. a doctor can treat ed by - treating the cause of your ed: - lifestyle changes - changing the medicines you take to treat other health problems - counseling - prescribing medicines to treat your ed: - medicine by mouth - other forms of medicine - prescribing a vacuum device - performing surgery: - implanted devices - surgery to repair blood vessels treating the cause of your erectile dysfunction the first step is to treat any health problems that may be causing your ed. untreated diabetes or high blood pressure may be part of the cause of your ed. lifestyle changes. for some men, the following lifestyle changes help: - quitting smoking - drinking less alcohol - increasing physical activity - stopping illegal drug use changing medicines you take to treat other health problems. talk with your doctor about all the medicines you are taking, including over-the-counter medicines. the doctor may find that a medicine you are taking is causing your ed. your doctor may be able to give you another medicine that works in a different way, or your doctor may tell you to try a lower dose of your medicine. counseling. counseling can help couples deal with the emotional effects of ed. some couples find that counseling adds to the medical treatment by making their relationship stronger. prescribing medicines to treat your erectile dysfunction depending on which medicine your doctor gives you, you may take it by mouth or by putting it directly into your penis. medicine by mouth. your doctor may be able to prescribe a pill to treat ed. common medicines include - sildenafil (viagra) - vardenafil (levitra, staxyn) - tadalafil (cialis) - avanafil (stendra) if your health is generally good, your doctor may prescribe one of these medicines. you should not take any of these pills to treat ed if you take any nitrates, a type of heart medicine. all ed pills work by increasing blood flow to the penis. they do not cause automatic erections. talk with your doctor about when to take the pill. you may need to experiment to find out how soon the pill takes effect. other forms of medicine. taking a pill doesnt work for all men. you may need to use medicine that goes directly into your penis. you may use an injection into the shaft of your penis, or you may use medicine placed in your urethra, at the tip of your penis. the urethra is the tube that carries urine and semen outside of the body. your doctor will teach you how to use the medicines. they most often cause an erection within minutes. these medicines can be successful, even if other treatments fail. prescribing a vacuum device another way to create an erection is to use a device with a specially designed vacuum tube. you put your penis into the tube, which is connected to a pump. as air is pumped out of the tube, blood flows into your penis and makes it larger and firmer. you then move a specially designed elastic ring from the end of the tube to the base of your penis to keep the blood from flowing back into your body. you may find that using a vacuum device requires some practice. performing surgery if the other options fail, you may need surgery to treat ed. implanted devices. a urologist can place a device that fills with fluid or a device with bendable rods inside the penis to create an erection. one kind of implant uses two cylinders that fill with fluid like a balloon. tubing connects the cylinders to a small ball that holds the fluid. you fill the cylinders by squeezing a small pump that the urologist places under the skin of the scrotum, in front of your testes. the pump causes fluid to flow into the two cylinders in your penis, making it hard. the fluid can make the penis slightly longer and wider. an implant that uses fluids instead of bendable rods leaves the penis in a more natural state when not in use. implants that bend most often have two rods that the urologist places side by side in your penis during surgery. you use your hands to adjust the position of the rods to make your penis straight. your penis does not get larger. after sex, you bend the rods down. implanted devices do not affect the way sex feels or the ability to have an orgasm. once you have an implanted device, you must use the device to have an erection every time. talk with your doctor about the pros and cons of having an implanted device. surgery to repair blood vessels. doctors treat some cases of ed with surgery to repair the blood vessels that carry blood to the penis. this type of surgery is more likely to work in men younger than 30."
who is at risk for what i need to know about diverticular disease? ?,"many people get diverticular disease. starting at age 40, the chance of getting it increases about every 10 years. about half of people between the ages of 60 and 80 have diverticular disease. almost everyone over 80 has it."
what to do for prevent diabetes problems: keep your nervous system healthy ?,"you can keep your nervous system healthy by taking these steps: - eat healthy meals and follow the meal plan that you and your doctor or dietitian have worked out. - if you drink alcoholic beverages, limit your intake to no more than one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men. drinking too many alcoholic beverages can make nerve damage worse. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, what i need to know about eating and diabetes."
what are the symptoms of prevent diabetes problems: keep your kidneys healthy ?,"in the early stages, diabetic kidney disease does not have any symptoms. kidney disease happens so slowly that you may not feel sick at all for many years. you may not feel sick even when your kidneys do only half the job of healthy kidneys. only your doctor can tell if you have kidney disease by checking the protein, or albumin, level in your urine at least once a year. the first symptom of diabetic kidney disease is often swelling in parts of your body, such as your hands, face, feet, or ankles. also, large amounts of protein in your urine may cause urine to look foamy. once your kidney function starts to decrease, other symptoms may include - increased or decreased urination - feeling drowsy or tired - feeling itchy or numb - dry skin - headaches - weight loss - not feeling hungry - feeling sick to your stomach - vomiting - sleep problems - trouble staying focused - darkened skin - muscle cramps"
what is (are) proctitis ?,"proctitis is inflammation of the lining of the rectum, the lower end of the large intestine leading to the anus. the large intestine and anus are part of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract. the gi tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. the movement of muscles in the gi tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, allows for the digestion of food. with proctitis, inflammation of the rectal liningcalled the rectal mucosais uncomfortable and sometimes painful. the condition may lead to bleeding or mucous discharge from the rectum, among other symptoms."
what causes proctitis ?,"proctitis has many causes, including acute, or sudden and short-term, and chronic, or long-lasting, conditions. among the causes are the following: - sexually transmitted diseases (stds). stds that can be passed when a person is receiving anal sex are a common cause of proctitis. common std infections that can cause proctitis include gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and herpes. herpes-induced proctitis may be particularly severe in people who are also infected with the hiv virus. - non-std infections. infections that are not sexually transmitted also can cause proctitis. salmonella and shigella are examples of foodborne bacteria that can cause proctitis. streptococcal proctitis sometimes occurs in children who have strep throat. - anorectal trauma. proctitis can be caused by trauma to the anorectal areawhich includes the rectum and anusfrom anal sex or the insertion of objects or harmful substances into the rectum, including the chemicals in some enemas. - ulcerative colitis and crohns disease. two forms of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd)ulcerative colitis and crohns diseasecan cause proctitis. ulcerative colitis causes irritation and ulcers, also called sores, in the inner lining of the colonpart of the large intestineand rectum. crohns disease usually causes irritation in the lower small intestinealso called the ileumor the colon, but it can affect any part of the gi tract. - radiation therapy. people who have had radiation therapy that targets the pelvic area also may develop proctitis. examples of those at risk are people with rectal, ovarian, or prostate cancer who have received radiation treatment directed to those areas. symptoms of radiation proctitis, most commonly rectal bleeding, will typically occur within 6 weeks after beginning radiation therapy or more than 9 months after its completion. - antibiotics. use of antibiotics may be associated with proctitis in some people. while meant to kill infectioncausing bacteria, antibiotics can also kill nonharmful, or commensal, bacteria in the gi tract. the loss of commensal bacteria can then allow other harmful bacteria known as clostridium difficile to cause an infection in the colon and rectum."
what causes short bowel syndrome ?,"the main cause of short bowel syndrome is surgery to remove a portion of the small intestine. this surgery can treat intestinal diseases, injuries, or birth defects. some children are born with an abnormally short small intestine or with part of their bowel missing, which can cause short bowel syndrome. in infants, short bowel syndrome most commonly occurs following surgery to treat necrotizing enterocolitis, a condition in which part of the tissue in the intestines is destroyed.1 short bowel syndrome may also occur following surgery to treat conditions such as - cancer and damage to the intestines caused by cancer treatment - crohn's disease, a disorder that causes inflammation, or swelling, and irritation of any part of the digestive tract - gastroschisis, which occurs when the intestines stick out of the body through one side of the umbilical cord - internal hernia, which occurs when the small intestine is displaced into pockets in the abdominal lining - intestinal atresia, which occurs when a part of the intestines doesn't form completely - intestinal injury from loss of blood flow due to a blocked blood vessel - intestinal injury from trauma - intussusception, in which one section of either the large or small intestine folds into itself, much like a collapsible telescope - meconium ileus, which occurs when the meconium, a newborn's first stool, is thicker and stickier than normal and blocks the ileum - midgut volvulus, which occurs when blood supply to the middle of the small intestine is completely cut off - omphalocele, which occurs when the intestines, liver, or other organs stick out through the navel, or belly button even if a person does not have surgery, disease or injury can damage the small intestine."
how to diagnose short bowel syndrome ?,"a health care provider diagnoses short bowel syndrome based on - a medical and family history - a physical exam - blood tests - fecal fat tests - an x-ray of the small and large intestines - upper gastrointestinal (gi) series - computerized tomography (ct) scan medical and family history taking a medical and family history may help a health care provider diagnose short bowel syndrome. he or she will ask the patient about symptoms and may request a history of past operations. physical exam a physical exam may help diagnose short bowel syndrome. during a physical exam, a health care provider usually - examines a patient's body, looking for muscle wasting or weight loss and signs of vitamin and mineral deficiencies - uses a stethoscope to listen to sounds in the abdomen - taps on specific areas of the patient's body blood tests a blood test involves drawing a patient's blood at a health care provider's office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. blood tests can show mineral and vitamin levels and measure complete blood count. fecal fat tests a fecal fat test measures the body's ability to break down and absorb fat. for this test, a patient provides a stool sample at a health care provider's office. the patient may also use a take-home test kit. the patient collects stool in plastic wrap that he or she lays over the toilet seat and places a sample into a container. a patient can also use a special tissue provided by the health care provider's office to collect the sample and place the tissue into the container. for children wearing diapers, the parent or caretaker can line the diaper with plastic to collect the stool. the health care provider will send the sample to a lab for analysis. a fecal fat test can show how well the small intestine is working. x-ray an x-ray is a picture created by using radiation and recorded on film or on a computer. the amount of radiation used is small. an x-ray technician performs the x-ray at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. an x-ray of the small intestine can show that the last segment of the large intestine is narrower than normal. blocked stool causes the part of the intestine just before this narrow segment to stretch and bulge. upper gastrointestinal series upper gi series, also called a barium swallow, uses x rays and fluoroscopy to help diagnose problems of the upper gi tract. fluoroscopy is a form of x ray that makes it possible to see the internal organs and their motion on a video monitor. an x-ray technician performs this test at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologist interprets the images. during the procedure, the patient will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. barium coats the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine so the radiologist and a health care provider can see the shape of these organs more clearly on x-rays. a patient may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. for several days afterward, barium liquid in the gi tract causes white or light-colored stools. a health care provider will give the patient specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test. upper gi series can show narrowing and widening of the small and large intestines. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, upper gi series. computerized tomography scan computerized tomography scans use a combination of x-rays and computer technology to create images. for a ct scan, a health care provider may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called a contrast medium. ct scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that takes x-rays. an x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. the patient does not need anesthesia. ct scans can show bowel obstruction and changes in the intestines."
what are the treatments for short bowel syndrome ?,"a health care provider will recommend treatment for short bowel syndrome based on a patient's nutritional needs. treatment may include - nutritional support - medications - surgery - intestinal transplant nutritional support the main treatment for short bowel syndrome is nutritional support, which may include the following: - oral rehydration. adults should drink water, sports drinks, sodas without caffeine, and salty broths. children should drink oral rehydration solutionsspecial drinks that contain salts and minerals to prevent dehydrationsuch as pedialyte, naturalyte, infalyte, and ceralyte, which are sold in most grocery stores and drugstores. - parenteral nutrition. this treatment delivers fluids, electrolytes, and liquid vitamins and minerals into the bloodstream through an intravenous (iv) tubea tube placed into a vein. health care providers give parenteral nutrition to people who cannot or should not get their nutrition or enough fluids through eating. - enteral nutrition. this treatment delivers liquid food to the stomach or small intestine through a feeding tubea small, soft, plastic tube placed through the nose or mouth into the stomach. gallstonessmall, pebblelike substances that develop in the gallbladderare a complication of enteral nutrition. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, gallstones. - vitamin and mineral supplements. a person may need to take vitamin and mineral supplements during or after parenteral or enteral nutrition. - special diet. a health care provider can recommend a specific diet plan for the patient that may include - small, frequent feedings - avoiding foods that can cause diarrhea, such as foods high in sugar, protein, and fiber - avoiding high-fat foods medications a health care provider may prescribe medications to treat short bowel syndrome, including - antibiotics to prevent bacterial overgrowth - h2 blockers to treat too much gastric acid secretion - proton pump inhibitors to treat too much gastric acid secretion - choleretic agents to improve bile flow and prevent liver disease - bile-salt binders to decrease diarrhea - anti-secretin agents to reduce gastric acid in the intestine - hypomotility agents to increase the time it takes food to travel through the intestines, leading to increased nutrient absorption - growth hormones to improve intestinal absorption - teduglutide to improve intestinal absorption surgery the goal of surgery is to increase the small intestine's ability to absorb nutrients. approximately half of the patients with short bowel syndrome need surgery.2 surgery used to treat short bowel syndrome includes procedures that - prevent blockage and preserve the length of the small intestine - narrow any dilated segment of the small intestine - slow the time it takes for food to travel through the small intestine - lengthen the small intestine long-term treatment and recovery, which for some may take years, depend in part on - what sections of the small intestine were removed - how much of the intestine is damaged - how well the muscles of the intestine work - how well the remaining small intestine adapts over time intestinal transplant an intestinal transplant is surgery to remove a diseased or an injured small intestine and replace it with a healthy small intestine from a person who has just died, called a donor. sometimes a living donor can provide a segment of his or her small intestine. transplant surgeonsdoctors who specialize in performing transplant surgeryperform the surgery on patients for whom other treatments have failed and who have lifethreatening complications from long-term parenteral nutrition. an intestinal-transplant team performs the surgery in a hospital. the patient will need anesthesia. complications of intestinal transplantation include infections and rejection of the transplanted organ. a successful intestinal transplant can be a life-saving treatment for people with intestinal failure caused by short bowel syndrome. by 2008, transplant surgeons had performed almost 2,000 intestinal transplantations in the united statesapproximately 75 percent of which were in patients younger than 18 years of age.3 a health care provider will tailor treatment to the severity of the patient's disease: - treatment for mild short bowel syndrome involves eating small, frequent meals; drinking fluid; taking nutritional supplements; and using medications to treat diarrhea. - treatment for moderate short bowel syndrome is similar to that for mild short bowel syndrome, with the addition of parenteral nutrition as needed. - treatment for severe short bowel syndrome involves use of parenteral nutrition and oral rehydration solutions. patients may receive enteral nutrition or continue normal eating, even though most of the nutrients are not absorbed. both enteral nutrition and normal eating stimulate the remaining intestine to work better and may allow patients to discontinue parenteral nutrition. some patients with severe short bowel syndrome require parenteral nutrition indefinitely or surgery."
how to prevent short bowel syndrome ?,"people can ask their health care providers about surgical techniques that minimize scar tissue. scientists have not yet found a way to prevent short bowel syndrome that is present at birth, as its cause is unknown."
what is (are) simple kidney cysts ?,"simple kidney cysts are abnormal, fluid-filled sacs that form in the kidneys. simple kidney cysts are different from the cysts that develop when a person has polycystic kidney disease (pkd), which is a genetic disorder. simple kidney cysts do not enlarge the kidneys, replace their normal structure, or cause reduced kidney function like cysts do in people with pkd. simple kidney cysts are more common as people age. an estimated 25 percent of people 40 years of age and 50 percent of people 50 years of age have simple kidney cysts.1"
what is (are) simple kidney cysts ?,"the kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. they are located near the middle of the back, just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. every day, the two kidneys process about 200 quarts of blood to filter out about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of waste products and extra water. the urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called ureters. the bladder stores urine until releasing it through urination."
how to diagnose kidney disease of diabetes ?,"people with diabetes should be screened regularly for kidney disease. the two key markers for kidney disease are egfr and urine albumin. - egfr. egfr stands for estimated glomerular filtration rate. each kidney contains about 1 million tiny filters made up of blood vessels. these filters are called glomeruli. kidney function can be checked by estimating how much blood the glomeruli filter in a minute. the calculation of egfr is based on the amount of creatinine, a waste product, found in a blood sample. as the level of creatinine goes up, the egfr goes down. kidney disease is present when egfr is less than 60 milliliters per minute. the american diabetes association (ada) and the national institutes of health (nih) recommend that egfr be calculated from serum creatinine at least once a year in all people with diabetes. - urine albumin. urine albumin is measured by comparing the amount of albumin to the amount of creatinine in a single urine sample. when the kidneys are healthy, the urine will contain large amounts of creatinine but almost no albumin. even a small increase in the ratio of albumin to creatinine is a sign of kidney damage. kidney disease is present when urine contains more than 30 milligrams of albumin per gram of creatinine, with or without decreased egfr. the ada and the nih recommend annual assessment of urine albumin excretion to assess kidney damage in all people with type 2 diabetes and people who have had type 1 diabetes for 5 years or more. if kidney disease is detected, it should be addressed as part of a comprehensive approach to the treatment of diabetes."

what are the symptoms of diarrhea ?,"diarrhea may be accompanied by cramping, abdominal pain, nausea, an urgent need to use the bathroom, or loss of bowel control. some infections that cause diarrhea can also cause a fever and chills or bloody stools. dehydration diarrhea can cause dehydration. loss of electrolytes through dehydration affects the amount of water in the body, muscle activity, and other important functions. dehydration is particularly dangerous in children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems. dehydration must be treated promptly to avoid serious health problems, such as organ damage, shock, or comaa sleeplike state in which a person is not conscious. signs of dehydration in adults include - thirst - less frequent urination than usual - dark-colored urine - dry skin - fatigue - dizziness - light-headedness signs of dehydration in infants and young children include - dry mouth and tongue - no tears when crying - no wet diapers for 3 hours or more - sunken eyes, cheeks, or soft spot in the skull - high fever - listlessness or irritability also, when people are dehydrated, their skin does not flatten back to normal right away after being gently pinched and released. anyone with signs of dehydration should see a health care provider immediately. severe dehydration may require hospitalization. although drinking plenty of water is important in preventing dehydration, water does not contain electrolytes. adults can prevent dehydration by also drinking liquids that contain electrolytes, such as fruit juices, sports drinks, caffeine-free soft drinks, and broths. children with diarrhea should be given oral rehydration solutions such as pedialyte, naturalyte, infalyte, and ceralyte to prevent dehydration."
what causes wilson disease ?,"wilson disease is caused by an inherited autosomal recessive mutation, or change, in the atp7b gene. in an autosomal recessive disease, the child has to inherit the gene mutation from both parents to have an increased likelihood for the disease. the chance of a child inheriting autosomal recessive mutations from both parents with a gene mutation is 25 percent, or one in four. if only one parent carries the mutated gene, the child will not get the disease, although the child may inherit one copy of the gene mutation. the child is called a carrier of the disease and can pass the gene mutation to the next generation. genetic testing is a procedure that identifies changes in a patients genes and can show whether a parent or child is a carrier of a mutated gene. autosomal recessive diseases are typically not seen in every generation of an affected family. the following chart shows the chance of inheriting an autosomal recessive mutation from parents who both carry the mutated gene. genetic diseases each cell contains thousands of genes that provide the instructions for making proteins for growth and repair of the body. if a gene has a mutation, the protein made by that gene may not function properly. not all gene mutations cause a disease. people have two copies of most genes; they inherit one copy from each parent. a genetic disease occurs when one or both parents pass a mutated gene to a child at conception. a genetic disease can also occur through a spontaneous gene mutation, meaning neither parent carries a copy of the mutated gene. once a spontaneous gene mutation has occurred in a person, that person can pass the gene mutation on to a child. read more about genes and genetic conditions in the u.s. national library of medicines genetics home reference at www.ghr.nlm.nih.gov."
what are the symptoms of crohn's disease ?,"the most common signs and symptoms of crohn's disease are - diarrhea - abdominal cramping and pain - weight loss other general signs and symptoms include - feeling tired - nausea or loss of appetite - fever - anemiaa condition in which the body has fewer red blood cells than normal signs and symptoms of inflammation outside of the intestines include - joint pain or soreness - eye irritation - skin changes that involve red, tender bumps under the skin the symptoms a person experiences can vary depending on the severity of the inflammation and where it occurs."
how to diagnose crohn's disease ?,"a health care provider diagnoses crohn's disease with the following: - medical and family history - physical exam - lab tests - upper gi series - computerized tomography (ct) scan - intestinal endoscopy the health care provider may perform a series of medical tests to rule out other bowel diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, or celiac disease, that cause symptoms similar to those of crohn's disease. medical and family history taking a medical and family history can help a health care provider diagnose crohn's disease and understand a patient's symptoms. he or she will ask the patient to describe his or her - family history - symptoms - current and past medical conditions - current medications physical exam a physical exam may help diagnose crohn's disease. during a physical exam, the health care provider most often - checks for abdominal distension, or swelling - listens to sounds within the abdomen using a stethoscope - taps on the abdomen to check for tenderness and pain and establish if the liver or spleen is abnormal or enlarged lab tests a health care provider may order lab tests, including blood and stool tests. blood tests. a blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider's office or a lab. a lab technologist will analyze the blood sample. a health care provider may use blood tests to look for changes in - red blood cells. when red blood cells are fewer or smaller than normal, a patient may have anemia. - white blood cells. when the white blood cell count is higher than normal, a person may have inflammation or infection somewhere in his or her body. stool tests. a stool test is the analysis of a sample of stool. a health care provider will give the patient a container for catching and storing the stool at home. the patient returns the sample to the health care provider or to a lab. a lab technologist will analyze the stool sample. health care providers commonly order stool tests to rule out other causes of gi diseases. upper gastrointestinal series an upper gi series, also called a barium swallow, uses x-rays and fluoroscopy to help diagnose problems of the upper gi tract. fluoroscopy is a form of x-ray that makes it possible to see the internal organs and their motion on a video monitor. an x-ray technician performs this test at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. this test does not require anesthesia. a patient should not eat or drink before the procedure, as directed by the health care provider. patients should ask their health care provider about how to prepare for an upper gi series. during the procedure, the patient will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. barium coats the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine so the radiologist and a health care provider can see the shape of these organs more clearly on x-rays. a patient may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. for several days afterward, barium liquid in the gi tract causes white or light-colored stools. a health care provider will give the patient specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test. computerized tomography scan computerized tomography scans use a combination of x-rays and computer technology to create images. for a ct scan, a health care provider may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. ct scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x-rays are taken. an x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. the patient does not need anesthesia. ct scans can diagnose both crohn's disease and the complications seen with the disease. intestinal endoscopy intestinal endoscopies are the most accurate methods for diagnosing crohn's disease and ruling out other possible conditions, such as ulcerative colitis, diverticular disease, or cancer. intestinal endoscopies include - upper gi endoscopy and enteroscopy - capsule endoscopy - colonoscopy upper gi endoscopy and enteroscopy. an upper gi endoscopy is a procedure that uses an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto directly visualize the lining of the upper gi tract. a health care provider performs the procedure at a hospital or an outpatient center. a nurse or technician may give the patient a liquid anesthetic to gargle or will spray the anesthetic on the back of a patient's throat. the anesthetic numbs the throat and calms the gag reflex. the nurse or technician will then place an intravenous (iv) needle in the person's arm or hand to provide a sedative. the health care provider carefully feeds the endoscope down the patient's esophagus and into the stomach. a small camera on the endoscope sends a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the gi tract. during an enteroscopy, the health care provider examines the small intestine with a special, longer endoscope. the health care provider carefully feeds the endoscope into the small intestine using one of the following procedures: - push enteroscopy, which uses a long endoscope to examine the upper portion of the small intestine - single- or double-balloon enteroscopy, which use small balloons to help move the endoscope into the small intestine - spiral enteroscopy, which uses a tube attached to an endocope that acts as a cork screw to move the instrument into the small intestine the procedure most often takes between 15 and 60 minutes. the endoscope does not interfere with the patient's breathing, and many patients fall asleep during the procedure. capsule endoscopy. although this procedure can examine the entire digestive tract, health care providers use it mostly to examine the small intestine. the patient swallows a capsule containing a tiny camera. as the capsule passes through the gi tract, the camera will record and transmit images to a small receiver device worn by the patient. when the recording is done, the health care provider downloads the images and reviews them on a video monitor. the camera capsule leaves the patient's body during a bowel movement and is safely flushed down the toilet. colonoscopy. colonoscopy is a test that uses a long, flexible, narrow tube with a light and tiny camera on one end, called a colonoscope or scope, to look inside a patient's rectum and entire colon. in most cases, light anesthesia and pain medication help patients relax for the test. the medical staff will monitor a patient's vital signs and try to make him or her as comfortable as possible. a nurse or technician will place an iv needle in a vein in the patient's arm or hand to give anesthesia. for the test, the patient will lie on a table or stretcher while the gastroenterologist inserts a colonoscope into the patient's anus and slowly guides it through the rectum and into the colon. the scope inflates the large intestine with air to give the gastroenterologist a better view. the camera sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a monitor, allowing the gastroenterologist to examine the tissues lining the colon and rectum. the gastroenterologist may move the patient several times and adjust the scope for better viewing. once the scope has reached the opening to the small intestine, the gastroenterologist slowly withdraws it and examines the lining of the colon and rectum again. a colonoscopy can show inflamed and swollen tissue, ulcers, and abnormal growths such as polypsextra pieces of tissue that grow on the inner lining of the intestine. if the gastroenterologist suspects crohn's disease, he or she will biopsy the patient's colon and rectum. a biopsy is a procedure that involves taking small pieces of tissue for examination with a microscope. a health care provider will give patients written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. the health care provider will also give patients information about how to care for themselves following the procedure."
what to do for what i need to know about kidney stones ?,"you can help prevent kidney stones by making changes in how much you consume of the following: - fluids - sodium - animal protein - calcium - oxalate drinking enough fluids each day is the best way to help prevent most types of kidney stones. you should drink 2 to 3 liters of fluid a day. if you had cystine stones, you may need to drink even more. though water is best, other fluids may also help prevent kidney stones, such as orange juice or lemonade. talk with your health care provider if you cant drink the recommended amount due to other health problems, such as urinary incontinence, urinary frequency, or kidney failure. you can make the following changes to your diet based on the type of kidney stone you had: calcium oxalate stones - reduce sodium - reduce animal protein, such as meat, eggs, and fish - get enough calcium from food or take calcium supplements with food - avoid foods high in oxalate, such as spinach, rhubarb, nuts, and wheat bran calcium phosphate stones - reduce sodium - reduce animal protein - get enough calcium from food or take calcium supplements with food uric acid stones - limit animal protein more information about how changes in diet affect kidney stone formation is provided in the niddk health topic, diet for kidney stone prevention. medicines your doctor may prescribe medicines based on the type of kidney stone you had and any health problems you have that make you more likely to form a stone."

what to do for hypoglycemia ?,"two types of hypoglycemia can occur in people who do not have diabetes: - reactive hypoglycemia, also called postprandial hypoglycemia, occurs within 4 hours after meals. - fasting hypoglycemia, also called postabsorptive hypoglycemia, is often related to an underlying disease. symptoms of both reactive and fasting hypoglycemia are similar to diabetes-related hypoglycemia. symptoms may include hunger, sweating, shakiness, dizziness, light-headedness, sleepiness, confusion, difficulty speaking, anxiety, and weakness. to find the cause of a patient's hypoglycemia, the doctor will use laboratory tests to measure blood glucose, insulin, and other chemicals that play a part in the body's use of energy. reactive hypoglycemia diagnosis to diagnose reactive hypoglycemia, the doctor may - ask about signs and symptoms - test blood glucose while the patient is having symptoms by taking a blood sample from the arm and sending it to a laboratory for analysis* - check to see whether the symptoms ease after the patient's blood glucose returns to 70 mg/dl or above after eating or drinking a blood glucose level below 70 mg/dl at the time of symptoms and relief after eating will confirm the diagnosis. the oral glucose tolerance test is no longer used to diagnose reactive hypoglycemia because experts now know the test can actually trigger hypoglycemic symptoms. causes and treatment the causes of most cases of reactive hypoglycemia are still open to debate. some researchers suggest that certain people may be more sensitive to the body's normal release of the hormone epinephrine, which causes many of the symptoms of hypoglycemia. others believe deficiencies in glucagon secretion might lead to reactive hypoglycemia. a few causes of reactive hypoglycemia are certain, but they are uncommon. gastricor stomachsurgery can cause reactive hypoglycemia because of the rapid passage of food into the small intestine. rare enzyme deficiencies diagnosed early in life, such as hereditary fructose intolerance, also may cause reactive hypoglycemia. to relieve reactive hypoglycemia, some health professionals recommend - eating small meals and snacks about every 3 hours - being physically active - eating a variety of foods, including meat, poultry, fish, or nonmeat sources of protein; starchy foods such as whole-grain bread, rice, and potatoes; fruits; vegetables; and dairy products - eating foods high in fiber - avoiding or limiting foods high in sugar, especially on an empty stomach the doctor can refer patients to a registered dietitian for personalized meal planning advice. although some health professionals recommend a diet high in protein and low in carbohydrates, studies have not proven the effectiveness of this kind of diet to treat reactive hypoglycemia. fasting hypoglycemia diagnosis fasting hypoglycemia is diagnosed from a blood sample that shows a blood glucose level below 50 mg/dl after an overnight fast, between meals, or after physical activity. causes and treatment causes of fasting hypoglycemia include certain medications, alcoholic beverages, critical illnesses, hormonal deficiencies, some kinds of tumors, and certain conditions occurring in infancy and childhood. medications. medications, including some used to treat diabetes, are the most common cause of hypoglycemia. other medications that can cause hypoglycemia include - salicylates, including aspirin, when taken in large doses - sulfa medications, which are used to treat bacterial infections - pentamidine, which treats a serious kind of pneumonia - quinine, which is used to treat malaria if using any of these medications causes a person's blood glucose level to fall, the doctor may advise stopping the medication or changing the dose. alcoholic beverages. drinking alcoholic beverages, especially binge drinking, can cause hypoglycemia. the body's breakdown of alcohol interferes with the liver's efforts to raise blood glucose. hypoglycemia caused by excessive drinking can be serious and even fatal. critical illnesses. some illnesses that affect the liver, heart, or kidneys can cause hypoglycemia. sepsis, which is an overwhelming infection, and starvation are other causes of hypoglycemia. in these cases, treating the illness or other underlying cause will correct the hypoglycemia. hormonal deficiencies. hormonal deficiencies may cause hypoglycemia in very young children, but rarely in adults. shortages of cortisol, growth hormone, glucagon, or epinephrine can lead to fasting hypoglycemia. laboratory tests for hormone levels will determine a diagnosis and treatment. hormone replacement therapy may be advised. tumors. insulinomas are insulin-producing tumors in the pancreas. insulinomas can cause hypoglycemia by raising insulin levels too high in relation to the blood glucose level. these tumors are rare and do not normally spread to other parts of the body. laboratory tests can pinpoint the exact cause. treatment involves both short-term steps to correct the hypoglycemia and medical or surgical measures to remove the tumor. conditions occurring in infancy and childhood. children rarely develop hypoglycemia. if they do, causes may include the following: - brief intolerance to fasting, often during an illness that disturbs regular eating patterns. children usually outgrow this tendency by age 10. - hyperinsulinism, which is the overproduction of insulin. this condition can result in temporary hypoglycemia in newborns, which is common in infants of mothers with diabetes. persistent hyperinsulinism in infants or children is a complex disorder that requires prompt evaluation and treatment by a specialist. - enzyme deficiencies that affect carbohydrate metabolism. these deficiencies can interfere with the body's ability to process natural sugars, such as fructose and galactose, glycogen, or other metabolites. - hormonal deficiencies such as lack of pituitary or adrenal hormones. *a personal blood glucose monitor cannot be used to diagnose reactive hypoglycemia."
what to do for hypoglycemia ?,"diabetes-related hypoglycemia - when people with diabetes think their blood glucose level is low, they should check it and treat the problem right away. - to treat hypoglycemia, people should have a serving of a quick-fix food, wait 15 minutes, and check their blood glucose again. they should repeat the treatment until their blood glucose is 70 mg/dl or above. - people at risk for hypoglycemia should keep quick-fix foods in the car, at workanywhere they spend time. - people at risk for hypoglycemia should be careful when driving. they should check their blood glucose frequently and snack as needed to keep their level 70 mg/dl or above. hypoglycemia unrelated to diabetes - in reactive hypoglycemia, symptoms occur within 4 hours of eating. people with reactive hypoglycemia are usually advised to follow a healthy eating plan recommended by a registered dietitian. - fasting hypoglycemia can be caused by certain medications, critical illnesses, hereditary enzyme or hormonal deficiencies, and some kinds of tumors. treatment targets the underlying problem."
what are the treatments for overview of kidney disease in children ?,"treatment for kidney disease in children depends on the cause of the illness. a child may be referred to a pediatric nephrologista doctor who specializes in treating kidney diseases and kidney failure in childrenfor treatment. children with a kidney disease that is causing high blood pressure may need to take medications to lower their blood pressure. improving blood pressure can significantly slow the progression of kidney disease. the health care provider may prescribe - angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors, which help relax blood vessels and make it easier for the heart to pump blood - angiotensin receptor blockers (arbs), which help relax blood vessels and make it easier for the heart to pump blood - diuretics, medications that increase urine output many children require two or more medications to control their blood pressure; other types of blood pressure medications may also be needed. as kidney function declines, children may need treatment for anemia and growth failure. anemia is treated with a hormone called erythropoietin, which stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. children with growth failure may need to make dietary changes and take food supplements or growth hormone injections. children with kidney disease that leads to kidney failure must receive treatment to replace the work the kidneys do. the two types of treatment are dialysis and transplantation. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, treatment methods for kidney failure in children. birth defects children with renal agenesis or renal dysplasia should be monitored for signs of kidney damage. treatment is not needed unless damage to the kidney occurs. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, solitary kidney. ectopic kidney does not need to be treated unless it causes a blockage in the urinary tract or damage to the kidney. when a blockage is present, surgery may be needed to correct the position of the kidney for better drainage of urine. if extensive kidney damage has occurred, surgery may be needed to remove the kidney. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, ectopic kidney. hereditary diseases children with pkd tend to have frequent urinary tract infections, which are treated with bacteria-fighting medications called antibiotics. pkd cannot be cured, so children with the condition receive treatment to slow the progression of kidney disease and treat the complications of pkd. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, polycystic kidney disease. alport syndrome also has no cure. children with the condition receive treatment to slow disease progression and treat complications until the kidneys fail. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, glomerular diseases. infection treatment for hemolytic uremic syndrome includes maintaining normal salt and fluid levels in the body to ease symptoms and prevent further problems. a child may need a transfusion of red blood cells delivered through an intravenous (iv) tube. some children may need dialysis for a short time to take over the work the kidneys usually do. most children recover completely with no long-term consequences. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, hemolytic uremic syndrome in children. children with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis may be treated with antibiotics to destroy any bacteria that remain in the body and with medications to control swelling and high blood pressure. they may also need dialysis for a short period of time. more information about post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is provided in the niddk health topic, glomerular diseases. nephrotic syndrome nephrotic syndrome due to minimal change disease can often be successfully treated with corticosteroids. corticosteroids decrease swelling and reduce the activity of the immune system. the dosage of the medication is decreased over time. relapses are common; however, they usually respond to treatment. corticosteroids are less effective in treating nephrotic syndrome due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. children with these conditions may be given other immunosuppressive medications in addition to corticosteroids. immunosuppressive medications prevent the body from making antibodies. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, childhood nephrotic syndrome. systemic diseases lupus nephritis is treated with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications. a child with lupus nephritis may also be treated with blood pressure-lowering medications. in many cases, treatment is effective in completely or partially controlling lupus nephritis. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, lupus nephritis. diabetic kidney disease usually takes many years to develop. children with diabetes can prevent or slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease by taking medications to control high blood pressure and maintaining normal blood glucose levels. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, kidney disease of diabetes. trauma the types of trauma described above can be medically treated, though dialysis may be needed for a short time until blood flow and blood pressure return to normal. urine blockage and reflux treatment for urine blockage depends on the cause and severity of the blockage. in some cases, the blockage goes away without treatment. for children who continue to have urine blockage, surgery may be needed to remove the obstruction and restore urine flow. after surgery, a small tube, called a stent, may be placed in the ureter or urethra to keep it open temporarily while healing occurs. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, urine blockage in newborns. treatment for reflux may include prompt treatment of urinary tract infections and long-term use of antibiotics to prevent infections until reflux goes away on its own. surgery has also been used in certain cases. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, vesicoureteral reflux."
what to do for overview of kidney disease in children ?,"for children with ckd, learning about nutrition is vital because their diet can affect how well their kidneys work. parents or guardians should always consult with their childs health care team before making any dietary changes. staying healthy with ckd requires paying close attention to the following elements of a diet: - protein. children with ckd should eat enough protein for growth while limiting high protein intake. too much protein can put an extra burden on the kidneys and cause kidney function to decline faster. protein needs increase when a child is on dialysis because the dialysis process removes protein from the childs blood. the health care team recommends the amount of protein needed for the child. foods with protein include - eggs - milk - cheese - chicken - fish - red meats - beans - yogurt - cottage cheese - sodium. the amount of sodium children need depends on the stage of their kidney disease, their age, and sometimes other factors. the health care team may recommend limiting or adding sodium and salt to the diet. foods high in sodium include - canned foods - some frozen foods - most processed foods - some snack foods, such as chips and crackers - potassium. potassium levels need to stay in the normal range for children with ckd, because too little or too much potassium can cause heart and muscle problems. children may need to stay away from some fruits and vegetables or reduce the number of servings and portion sizes to make sure they do not take in too much potassium. the health care team recommends the amount of potassium a child needs. low-potassium fruits and vegetables include - apples - cranberries - strawberries - blueberries - raspberries - pineapple - cabbage - boiled cauliflower - mustard greens - uncooked broccoli - high-potassium fruits and vegetables include - oranges - melons - apricots - bananas - potatoes - tomatoes - sweet potatoes - cooked spinach - cooked broccoli - phosphorus. children with ckd need to control the level of phosphorus in their blood because too much phosphorus pulls calcium from the bones, making them weaker and more likely to break. too much phosphorus also can cause itchy skin and red eyes. as ckd progresses, a child may need to take a phosphate binder with meals to lower the concentration of phosphorus in the blood. phosphorus is found in high-protein foods. foods with low levels of phosphorus include - liquid nondairy creamer - green beans - popcorn - unprocessed meats from a butcher - lemon-lime soda - root beer - powdered iced tea and lemonade mixes - rice and corn cereals - egg white - sorbet - fluids. early in ckd, a childs damaged kidneys may produce either too much or too little urine, which can lead to swelling or dehydration. as ckd progresses, children may need to limit fluid intake. the health care provider will tell the child and parents or guardians the goal for fluid intake. more information is provided in the niddk health topics, nutrition for chronic kidney disease in children and kidney failure: eat right to feel right on hemodialysis."
what to do for overview of kidney disease in children ?,"- kidney disease can affect children in various ways, ranging from treatable disorders without long-term consequences to life-threatening conditions. acute kidney disease develops suddenly, lasts a short time, and can be serious with long-lasting consequences, or may go away completely once the underlying cause has been treated. - chronic kidney disease (ckd) does not go away with treatment and tends to get worse over time. - kidney disease in children can be caused by - birth defects - hereditary diseases - infection - nephrotic syndrome - systemic diseases - trauma - urine blockage or reflux - a health care provider diagnoses kidney disease in children by completing a physical exam, asking for a medical history, and reviewing signs and symptoms. to confirm diagnosis, the health care provider may order one or more of the following tests: - urine tests - blood test - imaging studies - kidney biopsy - treatment for kidney disease in children depends on the cause of the illness. - children with a kidney disease that is causing high blood pressure may need to take medications to lower their blood pressure. improving blood pressure can significantly slow the progression of kidney disease. as kidney function declines, children may need treatment for anemia and growth failure. - children with kidney disease that leads to kidney failure must receive treatment to replace the work the kidneys do. the two types of treatment are dialysis and transplantation. - for children with ckd, learning about nutrition is vital because their diet can affect how well their kidneys work. parents or guardians should always consult with their childs health care team before making any dietary changes."
what causes peyronie's disease ?,"medical experts do not know the exact cause of peyronies disease. many believe that peyronies disease may be the result of - acute injury to the penis - chronic, or repeated, injury to the penis - autoimmune diseasea disorder in which the bodys immune system attacks the bodys own cells and organs injury to the penis medical experts believe that hitting or bending the penis may injure the tissues inside. a man may injure the penis during sex, athletic activity, or an accident. injury ruptures blood vessels, which leads to bleeding and swelling inside the layers of the tunica albuginea. swelling inside the penis will block blood flow through the layers of tissue inside the penis. when the blood cant flow normally, clots can form and trap immune system cells. as the injury heals, the immune system cells may release substances that lead to the formation of too much scar tissue. the scar tissue builds up and forms a plaque inside the penis. the plaque reduces the elasticity of tissues and flexibility of the penis during erection, leading to curvature. the plaque may further harden because of calcificationthe process in which calcium builds up in body tissue. autoimmune disease some medical experts believe that peyronies disease may be part of an autoimmune disease. normally, the immune system is the bodys way of protecting itself from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. men who have autoimmune diseases may develop peyronies disease when the immune system attacks cells in the penis. this can lead to inflammation in the penis and can cause scarring. medical experts do not know what causes autoimmune diseases. some of the autoimmune diseases associated with peyronies disease affect connective tissues. connective tissue is specialized tissue that supports, joins, or separates different types of tissues and organs of the body."
what are the treatments for peyronie's disease ?,"a urologist may treat peyronies disease with nonsurgical treatments or surgery. the goal of treatment is to reduce pain and restore and maintain the ability to have intercourse. men with small plaques, minimal penile curvature, no pain, and satisfactory sexual function may not need treatment until symptoms get worse. peyronies disease often resolves on its own without treatment. a urologist may recommend changes in a mans lifestyle to reduce the risk of ed associated with peyronies disease. nonsurgical treatments nonsurgical treatments include medications and medical therapies. medications. a urologist may prescribe medications aimed at decreasing a mans penile curvature, plaque size, and inflammation. a man may take prescribed medications to treat peyronies disease orallyby mouthor a urologist may inject medications directly into the plaque. verapamil is one type of topical medication that a man may apply to the skin over the plaque. - oral medications. oral medications may include - vitamin e - potassium para-aminobenzoate (potaba) - tamoxifen - colchicine - acetyl-l-carnitine - pentoxifylline - injections. medications injected directly into plaques may include - verapamil - interferon alpha 2b - steroids - collagenase (xiaflex) to date, collagenase is the first and only medication specifically approved for peyronies disease. medical therapies. a urologist may use medical therapies to break up scar tissue and decrease plaque size and curvature. therapies to break up scar tissue may include - high-intensity, focused ultrasound directed at the plaque - radiation therapyhigh-energy rays, such as x rays, aimed at the plaque - shockwave therapyfocused, low-intensity electroshock waves directed at the plaque a urologist may use iontophoresispainless, low-level electric current that delivers medications through the skin over the plaqueto decrease plaque size and curvature. a urologist may use mechanical traction and vacuum devices aimed at stretching or bending the penis to reduce curvature. surgery a urologist may recommend surgery to remove plaque or help straighten the penis during an erection. medical experts recommend surgery for long-term cases when - symptoms have not improved - erections, intercourse, or both are painful - the curve or bend in the penis does not allow the man to have sexual intercourse some men may develop complications after surgery, and sometimes surgery does not correct the effects of peyronies diseasesuch as shortening of the penis. some surgical methods can cause shortening of the penis. medical experts suggest waiting 1 year or more from the onset of symptoms before having surgery because the course of peyronies disease is different in each man. a urologist may recommend the following surgeries: - grafting. a urologist will cut or remove the plaque and attach a patch of skin, a vein, or material made from animal organs in its place. this procedure may straighten the penis and restore some lost length from peyronies disease. however, some men may experience numbness of the penis and ed after the procedure. - plication. a urologist will remove or pinch a piece of the tunica albuginea from the side of the penis opposite the plaque, which helps to straighten the penis. this procedure is less likely to cause numbness or ed. plication cannot restore length or girth of the penis and may cause shortening of the penis. - device implantation. a urologist implants a device into the penis that can cause an erection and help straighten it during an erection. penile implants may be considered if a man has both peyronies disease and ed. in some cases, an implant alone will straighten the penis adequately. if the implant alone does not straighten the penis, a urologist may combine implantation with one of the other two surgeries. once a man has an implant, he must use the device to have an erection. a urologist performs these surgeries in a hospital. lifestyle changes a man can make healthy lifestyle changes to reduce the chance of ed associated with peyronies disease by - quitting smoking - reducing alcohol consumption - exercising regularly - avoiding illegal drugs more information is provided in the niddk health topic, erectile dysfunction."
what causes acromegaly ?,"acromegaly is caused by prolonged overproduction of gh by the pituitary gland. the pituitary produces several important hormones that control body functions such as growth and development, reproduction, and metabolism. but hormones never seem to act simply and directly. they usually ""cascade"" or flow in a series, affecting each other's production or release into the bloodstream. gh is part of a cascade of hormones that, as the name implies, regulates the physical growth of the body. this cascade begins in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. the hypothalamus makes hormones that regulate the pituitary. one of the hormones in the gh series, or ""axis,"" is growth hormone-releasing hormone (ghrh), which stimulates the pituitary gland to produce gh. secretion of gh by the pituitary into the bloodstream stimulates the liver to produce another hormone called insulin-like growth factor i (igf-i). igf-i is what actually causes tissue growth in the body. high levels of igf-i, in turn, signal the pituitary to reduce gh production. the hypothalamus makes another hormone called somatostatin, which inhibits gh production and release. normally, ghrh, somatostatin, gh, and igf-i levels in the body are tightly regulated by each other and by sleep, exercise, stress, food intake, and blood sugar levels. if the pituitary continues to make gh independent of the normal regulatory mechanisms, the level of igf-i continues to rise, leading to bone overgrowth and organ enlargement. high levels of igf-i also cause changes in glucose (sugar) and lipid (fat) metabolism and can lead to diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. pituitary tumors in more than 95 percent of people with acromegaly, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland, called an adenoma, produces excess gh. pituitary tumors are labeled either micro- or macro-adenomas, depending on their size. most gh-secreting tumors are macro-adenomas, meaning they are larger than 1 centimeter. depending on their location, these larger tumors may compress surrounding brain structures. for example, a tumor growing upward may affect the optic chiasm-where the optic nerves crossleading to visual problems and vision loss. if the tumor grows to the side, it may enter an area of the brain called the cavernous sinus where there are many nerves, potentially damaging them. compression of the surrounding normal pituitary tissue can alter production of other hormones. these hormonal shifts can lead to changes in menstruation and breast discharge in women and erectile dysfunction in men. if the tumor affects the part of the pituitary that controls the thyroidanother hormone-producing glandthen thyroid hormones may decrease. too little thyroid hormone can cause weight gain, fatigue, and hair and skin changes. if the tumor affects the part of the pituitary that controls the adrenal gland, the hormone cortisol may decrease. too little cortisol can cause weight loss, dizziness, fatigue, low blood pressure, and nausea. some gh-secreting tumors may also secrete too much of other pituitary hormones. for example, they may produce prolactin, the hormone that stimulates the mammary glands to produce milk. rarely, adenomas may produce thyroid-stimulating hormone. doctors should assess all pituitary hormones in people with acromegaly. rates of gh production and the aggressiveness of the tumor vary greatly among people with adenomas. some adenomas grow slowly and symptoms of gh excess are often not noticed for many years. other adenomas grow more rapidly and invade surrounding brain areas or the venous sinuses, which are located near the pituitary gland. younger patients tend to have more aggressive tumors. regardless of size, these tumors are always benign. most pituitary tumors develop spontaneously and are not genetically inherited. they are the result of a genetic alteration in a single pituitary cell, which leads to increased cell division and tumor formation. this genetic change, or mutation, is not present at birth, but happens later in life. the mutation occurs in a gene that regulates the transmission of chemical signals within pituitary cells. it permanently switches on the signal that tells the cell to divide and secrete gh. the events within the cell that cause disordered pituitary cell growth and gh oversecretion currently are the subject of intensive research. nonpituitary tumors rarely, acromegaly is caused not by pituitary tumors but by tumors of the pancreas, lungs, and other parts of the brain. these tumors also lead to excess gh, either because they produce gh themselves or, more frequently, because they produce ghrh, the hormone that stimulates the pituitary to make gh. when these non-pituitary tumors are surgically removed, gh levels fall and the symptoms of acromegaly improve. in patients with ghrh-producing, non-pituitary tumors, the pituitary still may be enlarged and may be mistaken for a tumor. physicians should carefully analyze all ""pituitary tumors"" removed from patients with acromegaly so they do not overlook the rare possibility that a tumor elsewhere in the body is causing the disorder."
what are the treatments for gastroparesis ?,"treatment of gastroparesis depends on the severity of the persons symptoms. in most cases, treatment does not cure gastroparesis, which is usually a chronic, or long-lasting, condition. gastroparesis is also a relapsing conditionthe symptoms can come and go for periods of time. treatment helps people manage the condition so they can be as comfortable and active as possible."
what are the treatments for gastroparesis ?,"an elevated blood glucose level directly interferes with normal stomach emptying, so good blood glucose control in people with diabetes is important. however, gastroparesis can make blood glucose control difficult. when food that has been delayed in the stomach finally enters the small intestine and is absorbed, blood glucose levels rise. gastric emptying is unpredictable with gastroparesis, causing a persons blood glucose levels to be erratic and difficult to control. the primary treatment goals for gastroparesis related to diabetes are to improve gastric emptying and regain control of blood glucose levels. in addition to the dietary changes and treatments already described, a health care provider will likely adjust the persons insulin regimen. to better control blood glucose, people with diabetes and gastroparesis may need to - take insulin more often or change the type of insulin they take - take insulin after meals, instead of before - check blood glucose levels frequently after eating and administer insulin when necessary a health care provider will give specific instructions for taking insulin based on the individuals needs and the severity of gastroparesis. in some cases, the dietitian may suggest eating several liquid or pured meals a day until gastroparesis symptoms improve and blood glucose levels are more stable."
what to do for alagille syndrome ?,"researchers have not found that eating, diet, and nutrition play a role in causing or preventing alagille syndrome. however, these factors are important for people with alagille syndrome, particularly children, who are malnourished, growing poorly, or have delayed puberty. caregivers and parents of children with alagille syndrome should try to maximize their children's potential for growth through good eating, diet, and nutrition. a nutritionist or a dietitiana person with training in nutrition and dietcan work with someone with alagille syndrome and his or her health care team to build an appropriate healthy eating plan. a person with alagille syndrome may need to take dietary supplements or vitamins in addition to eating a set number of calories, based on the type of complications the person has. researchers consider good nutrition to be one of the most important aspects of managing the disorder. if potential liver problems are present, a person with alagille syndrome should not drink alcoholic beverages without talking with his or her health care provider first. additionally, eating, diet, and nutrition play a part in overall health and preventing further health problems."
what to do for alagille syndrome ?,"- alagille syndrome is a genetic condition that results in various symptoms in different parts of the body, including the liver. - a person with alagille syndrome has fewer than the normal number of small bile ducts inside the liver. - in people with alagille syndrome, the decreased number of bile ducts causes bile to build up in the liver, a condition also called cholestasis, leading to liver damage and liver disease. - alagille syndrome is caused by a gene mutation, or defect. approximately 30 to 50 percent of people with alagille syndrome have an inherited gene mutation, meaning it has been passed on by a parent. - alagille syndrome occurs in about one of every 30,000 live births. the disorder affects both sexes equally and shows no geographical, racial, or ethnic preferences. - the gene mutations that cause alagille syndrome may cause mild or subtle symptoms. some people may not know they are affected. - the signs and symptoms of alagille syndrome and their severity vary, even among people in the same family sharing the same gene mutation. - in some people, problems in the liver may be the first signs and symptoms of the disorder. - the complications of alagille syndrome include liver failure, portal hypertension, and growth problems. - ten to 30 percent of people with alagille syndrome will eventually need a liver transplant. - a health care provider diagnoses alagille syndrome by performing a thorough physical exam and other tests. - genetic counseling can help family members understand how genetic test results may affect them individually and as a family. - treatment for alagille syndrome includes medications and therapies that increase the flow of bile from the liver, promote growth and development in infants' and children's bodies, correct nutritional deficiencies, and reduce the person's discomfort. - scientists have not yet found a way to prevent alagille syndrome. - caregivers and parents of children with alagille syndrome should try to maximize their children's potential for growth through good eating, diet, and nutrition."
what are the symptoms of iga nephropathy ?,"in its early stages, iga nephropathy may have no symptoms; it can be silent for years or even decades. once symptoms appear, the most common one is hematuria, or blood in the urine. hematuria can be a sign of damaged glomeruli. blood in the urine may appear during or soon after a cold, sore throat, or other respiratory infection. the amount of blood may be - visible with the naked eye. the urine may turn pink or the color of tea or cola. sometimes a person may have dark or bloody urine. - so small that it can only be detected using special medical tests. another symptom of iga nephropathy is albuminuriawhen a persons urine contains an increased amount of albumin, a protein typically found in the blood, or large amounts of protein in the urine. albumin is the main protein in the blood. healthy kidneys keep most proteins in the blood from leaking into the urine. however, when the glomeruli are damaged, large amounts of protein leak out of the blood into the urine. when albumin leaks into the urine, the blood loses its capacity to absorb extra fluid from the body. too much fluid in the body may cause edema, or swelling, usually in the legs, feet, or ankles and less often in the hands or face. foamy urine is another sign of albuminuria. some people with iga nephropathy have both hematuria and albuminuria. after 10 to 20 years with iga nephropathy, about 20 to 40 percent of adults develop end-stage kidney disease.5 signs and symptoms of end-stage kidney disease may include - high blood pressure - little or no urination - edema - feeling tired - drowsiness - generalized itching or numbness - dry skin - headaches - weight loss - appetite loss - nausea - vomiting - sleep problems - trouble concentrating - darkened skin - muscle cramps"
what is (are) hemorrhoids ?,"hemorrhoids are swollen and inflamed veins around the anus or in the lower rectum. the rectum is the last part of the large intestine leading to the anus. the anus is the opening at the end of the digestive tract where bowel contents leave the body. external hemorrhoids are located under the skin around the anus. internal hemorrhoids develop in the lower rectum. internal hemorrhoids may protrude, or prolapse, through the anus. most prolapsed hemorrhoids shrink back inside the rectum on their own. severely prolapsed hemorrhoids may protrude permanently and require treatment."
who is at risk for anemia of inflammation and chronic disease? ?,"while ai/acd can affect people at any age, older adults are especially at risk because they have the highest rates of chronic disease. ai/acd is also common among hospitalized patients, particularly those with chronic illnesses. more than 130 million americans live with at least one chronic illness.2 addressing the causes of anemia in people with chronic disease can help improve their health and quality of life."
what to do for treatment methods for kidney failure: peritoneal dialysis ?,"eating the right foods can help you feel better while on peritoneal dialysis. talk with your dialysis centers dietitian to find a meal plan that works for you. your dietary needs will depend on your treatment and other factors such as your weight and activity level. staying healthy with ckd requires watching what is in your diet: - protein is in foods from animals and plants. protein provides the building blocks that maintain and repair muscles, organs, and other parts of your body. peritoneal dialysis can remove proteins from your body, so eat high-quality, protein-rich foods such as meat, fish, and eggs. however, many high-protein foods also contain phosphorous, which can weaken your bones. talk with your dietitian about ways to get the protein you need without getting too much phosphorous. - phosphorus is a mineral that helps your bones stay healthy and your blood vessels and muscles work. phosphorus is a natural part of foods rich in protein, and food producers often add it to many processed foods. phosphorus can weaken your bones and make your skin itch if you consume too much. peritoneal dialysis may not remove enough phosphorus from your body, so you will probably need to limit or avoid high-phosphorus foods such as milk and cheese, dried beans, peas, colas, nuts, and peanut butter. you may also need to take a pill called a phosphate binder that keeps phosphorus in your food from entering your bloodstream. - fluid includes water and drinks such as fruit juice and milk and water in foods such as fruits, vegetables, ice cream, gelatin, soup, and ice pops. you need water for your body to function properly; however, too much can cause swelling and make your heart work harder. over time, having too much fluid in your body can cause high blood pressure and congestive heart failure. peritoneal dialysis might cause you to have either too much or too little fluid, depending on the strength of the solution you use. your diet can also influence whether you have too much or too little fluid. your dietitian will help you determine how much liquid you need to consume each day. - sodium is a part of salt. many canned, packaged, frozen, and fast foods contain sodium. sodium is also a part of many condiments, seasonings, and meats. too much sodium makes you thirsty, which makes you drink more liquid. try to eat fresh foods that are naturally low in sodium, and look for products that say low sodium on the label, especially in canned and frozen foods. - potassium is a mineral that helps your nerves and muscles work the right way. peritoneal dialysis can pull too much potassium from your blood, so you may need to eat more high-potassium foods such as bananas, oranges, potatoes, and tomatoes. however, be careful not to eat too much potassium. your dietitian will help you choose the right amount. - calories are units for measuring the energy provided by foods and drinks. eating foods with too many calories, such as oily and sugary foods, can make you gain weight. your body can absorb the dextrose from your dialysis solution, which can increase your calorie intake. you may find you need to take in fewer calories to prevent weight gain. your dietitian can help you create and follow a diet to stay at a healthy weight. - supplements help provide some of the vitamins and minerals that may be missing from your diet. peritoneal dialysis also removes some vitamins from your body. your doctor may prescribe a vitamin and mineral supplement that scientists have designed specifically for people with ckd and kidney failure. never take vitamin and mineral supplements that you can buy over the counter. they may be harmful to you. talk with your doctor before taking any medicine, including vitamin and mineral supplements, that he or she has not prescribed for you. you may have a difficult time changing your diet at first. eating the right foods will help you feel better. you will have more strength and energy. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, make the kidney connection: food tips and healthy eating ideas."
what to do for treatment methods for kidney failure: peritoneal dialysis ?,"- peritoneal dialysis is a treatment for kidney failure that uses the lining of your abdomen, or belly, to filter your blood inside your body. - the two types of peritoneal dialysis are continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and automated peritoneal dialysis. - the most common problem with peritoneal dialysis is peritonitis, a serious abdominal infection. - when dialysis solution stays in the body too long, it becomes so full of wastes and extra fluid that it cannot absorb any more from the body. the process may even reverse, letting some wastes and extra fluid back into the body. - eating the right foods can help you feel better while on peritoneal dialysis. talk with your dialysis centers dietitian to find a meal plan that works for you."
what are the symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism ?,"most people with primary hyperparathyroidism have no symptoms. when symptoms appear, they are often mild and nonspecific, such as - muscle weakness - fatigue and an increased need for sleep - feelings of depression - aches and pains in bones and joints people with more severe disease may have - loss of appetite - nausea - vomiting - constipation - confusion or impaired thinking and memory - increased thirst and urination these symptoms are mainly due to the high blood calcium levels that result from excessive pth."
what is (are) irritable bowel syndrome in children ?,"irritable bowel syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal (gi) disorder, meaning it is a problem caused by changes in how the gi tract works. children with a functional gi disorder have frequent symptoms, but the gi tract does not become damaged. ibs is not a disease; it is a group of symptoms that occur together. the most common symptoms of ibs are abdominal pain or discomfort, often reported as cramping, along with diarrhea, constipation, or both. in the past, ibs was called colitis, mucous colitis, spastic colon, nervous colon, and spastic bowel. the name was changed to reflect the understanding that the disorder has both physical and mental causes and is not a product of a persons imagination. ibs is diagnosed when a child who is growing as expected has abdominal pain or discomfort once per week for at least 2 months without other disease or injury that could explain the pain. the pain or discomfort of ibs may occur with a change in stool frequency or consistency or may be relieved by a bowel movement."
what is (are) irritable bowel syndrome in children ?,"the gi tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. the movement of muscles in the gi tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, allows for the digestion of food. organs that make up the gi tract are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestinewhich includes the appendix, cecum, colon, and rectumand anus. the intestines are sometimes called the bowel. the last part of the gi tractcalled the lower gi tractconsists of the large intestine and anus. the large intestine absorbs water and any remaining nutrients from partially digested food passed from the small intestine. the large intestine then changes waste from liquid to a solid matter called stool. stool passes from the colon to the rectum. the rectum is located between the last part of the coloncalled the sigmoid colonand the anus. the rectum stores stool prior to a bowel movement. during a bowel movement, stool moves from the rectum to the anus, the opening through which stool leaves the body."
what to do for cirrhosis ?,"a healthy diet is important in all stages of cirrhosis because malnutrition is common in people with this disease. malnutrition is a condition that occurs when the body does not get enough nutrients. cirrhosis may lead to malnutrition because it can cause - people to eat less because of symptoms such as loss of appetite - changes in metabolism - reduced absorption of vitamins and minerals health care providers can recommend a meal plan that is well balanced and provides enough calories and protein. if ascites develops, a health care provider or dietitian may recommend a sodium-restricted diet. to improve nutrition, the health care provider may prescribe a liquid supplement. a person may take the liquid by mouth or through a nasogastric tubea tiny tube inserted through the nose and throat that reaches into the stomach. a person with cirrhosis should not eat raw shellfish, which can contain a bacterium that causes serious infection. cirrhosis affects the immune system, making people with cirrhosis more likely than healthy people to develop an infection after eating shellfish that contain this bacterium. a health care provider may recommend calcium and vitamin d supplements to help prevent osteoporosis."
what to do for cirrhosis ?,"- cirrhosis is a condition in which the liver slowly deteriorates and is unable to function normally due to chronic, or long lasting, injury. scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue and partially blocks the flow of blood through the liver. - the most common causes of cirrhosis in the united states are chronic hepatitis c, alcohol-related liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (nash), and chronic hepatitis b. - many people with cirrhosis have no symptoms in the early stages of the disease. however, as the disease progresses, a person may experience the following symptoms: - fatigue, or feeling tired - weakness - itching - loss of appetite - weight loss - nausea - bloating of the abdomen from ascitesa buildup of fluid in the abdomen - edemaswelling due to a buildup of fluidin the feet, ankles, or legs - spiderlike blood vessels, called spider angiomas, on the skin - jaundice, a condition that causes the skin and whites of the eyes to turn yellow - as the liver fails, complications may develop. in some people, complications may be the first signs of the disease. - a health care provider usually diagnoses cirrhosis based on the presence of conditions that increase its likelihood, such as heavy alcohol use or obesity, and symptoms. a health care provider may confirm the diagnosis with - a medical and family history - a physical exam - a blood test - imaging tests - a liver biopsy - treatment for cirrhosis depends on the cause of the disease and whether complications are present. - a health care provider may consider a liver transplant when cirrhosis leads to liver failure or treatment for complications is ineffective."
what are the symptoms of lactose intolerance ?,"common symptoms of lactose intolerance include - abdominal bloating, a feeling of fullness or swelling in the abdomen - abdominal pain - diarrhea - gas - nausea symptoms occur 30 minutes to 2 hours after consuming milk or milk products. symptoms range from mild to severe based on the amount of lactose the person ate or drank and the amount a person can tolerate."
what are the treatments for lactose intolerance ?,"many people can manage the symptoms of lactose intolerance by changing their diet. some people may only need to limit the amount of lactose they eat or drink. others may need to avoid lactose altogether. using lactase products can help some people manage their symptoms. for people with secondary lactase deficiency, treating the underlying cause improves lactose tolerance. in infants with developmental lactase deficiency, the ability to digest lactose improves as the infants mature. people with primary and congenital lactase deficiency cannot change their bodys ability to produce lactase."
what is (are) hyperthyroidism ?,"hyperthyroidism is a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland makes more thyroid hormone than the body needs. hyperthyroidism is sometimes called thyrotoxicosis, the technical term for too much thyroid hormone in the blood. thyroid hormones circulate throughout the body in the bloodstream and act on virtually every tissue and cell in the body. hyperthyroidism causes many of the bodys functions to speed up. about 1 percent of the u.s. population has hyperthyroidism.1"
what is (are) hyperthyroidism ?,"the thyroid is a 2-inch-long, butterfly-shaped gland weighing less than 1 ounce. located in the front of the neck below the larynx, or voice box, it has two lobes, one on each side of the windpipe. the thyroid is one of the glands that make up the endocrine system. the glands of the endocrine system produce, store, and release hormones into the bloodstream. the hormones then travel through the body and direct the activity of the bodys cells. the thyroid gland makes two thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (t3) and thyroxine (t4). t3 is made from t4 and is the more active hormone, directly affecting the tissues. thyroid hormones affect metabolism, brain development, breathing, heart and nervous system functions, body temperature, muscle strength, skin dryness, menstrual cycles, weight, and cholesterol levels. thyroid hormone production is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh), which is made by the pituitary gland in the brain. when thyroid hormone levels in the blood are low, the pituitary releases more tsh. when thyroid hormone levels are high, the pituitary responds by decreasing tsh production."
how to diagnose hyperthyroidism ?,"many symptoms of hyperthyroidism are the same as those of other diseases, so hyperthyroidism usually cannot be diagnosed based on symptoms alone. with suspected hyperthyroidism, health care providers take a medical history and perform a thorough physical exam. health care providers may then use several blood tests, such as the following, to confirm a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism and find its cause: tsh test. the ultrasensitive tsh test is usually the first test a health care provider performs. this test detects even tiny amounts of tsh in the blood and is the most accurate measure of thyroid activity available. the tsh test is especially useful in detecting mild hyperthyroidism. generally, a tsh reading below normal means a person has hyperthyroidism and a reading above normal means a person has hypothyroidism. health care providers may conduct additional tests to help confirm the diagnosis or determine the cause of hyperthyroidism. t3 and t4 test. this test shows the levels of t3 and t4 in the blood. with hyperthyroidism, the levels of one or both of these hormones in the blood are higher than normal. thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (tsi) test. this test, also called a thyroidstimulating antibody test, measures the level of tsi in the blood. most people with graves disease have this antibody, but people whose hyperthyroidism is caused by other conditions do not. radioactive iodine uptake test. the radioactive iodine uptake test measures the amount of iodine the thyroid collects from the bloodstream. measuring the amount of iodine in a persons thyroid helps the health care provider determine what is causing a persons hyperthyroidism. for example, low levels of iodine uptake might be a sign of thyroiditis, whereas high levels could indicate graves disease. thyroid scan. a thyroid scan shows how and where iodine is distributed in the thyroid. the images of nodules and other possible irregularities help the health care provider diagnose the cause of a persons hyperthyroidism. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, thyroid tests."
how to diagnose gastritis ?,"a health care provider diagnoses gastritis based on the following: - medical history - physical exam - upper gi endoscopy - other tests medical history taking a medical history may help the health care provider diagnose gastritis. he or she will ask the patient to provide a medical history. the history may include questions about chronic symptoms and travel to developing countries. physical exam a physical exam may help diagnose gastritis. during a physical exam, a health care provider usually - examines a patient's body - uses a stethoscope to listen to sounds in the abdomen - taps on the abdomen checking for tenderness or pain upper gastrointestinal endoscopy upper gi endoscopy is a procedure that uses an endoscopea small, flexible camera with a lightto see the upper gi tract. a health care provider performs the test at a hospital or an outpatient center. the health care provider carefully feeds the endoscope down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. the small camera built into the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the gi lining. a health care provider may give a patient a liquid anesthetic to gargle or may spray anesthetic on the back of the patient's throat before inserting the endoscope. a health care provider will place an intravenous (iv) needle in a vein in the arm to administer sedation. sedatives help patients stay relaxed and comfortable. the test may show signs of inflammation or erosions in the stomach lining. the health care provider can use tiny tools passed through the endoscope to perform biopsies. a biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of tissue for examination with a microscope by a pathologista doctor who specializes in examining tissues to diagnose diseases. a health care provider may use the biopsy to diagnose gastritis, find the cause of gastritis, and find out if chronic gastritis has progressed to atrophic gastritis. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, upper gi endoscopy. other tests a health care provider may have a patient complete other tests to identify the cause of gastritis or any complications. these tests may include the following: - upper gi series. upper gi series is an x-ray exam that provides a look at the shape of the upper gi tract. an x-ray technician performs this test at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. this test does not require anesthesia. a patient should not eat or drink before the procedure, as directed by the health care provider. patients should check with their health care provider about what to do to prepare for an upper gi series. during the procedure, the patient will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. barium coats the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine so the radiologist and health care provider can see these organs' shapes more clearly on x-rays. a patient may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. for several days afterward, barium liquid in the gi tract may cause white or light-colored stools. a health care provider will give the patient specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, upper gi series. - blood tests. a health care provider may use blood tests to check for anemia or h. pylori. a health care provider draws a blood sample during an office visit or at a commercial facility and sends the sample to a lab for analysis. - stool test. a health care provider may use a stool test to check for blood in the stool, another sign of bleeding in the stomach, and for h. pylori infection. a stool test is an analysis of a sample of stool. the health care provider will give the patient a container for catching and storing the stool. the patient returns the sample to the health care provider or a commercial facility that will send the sample to a lab for analysis. - urea breath test. a health care provider may use a urea breath test to check for h. pylori infection. the patient swallows a capsule, liquid, or pudding that contains ureaa waste product the body produces as it breaks down protein. the urea is labeled with a special carbon atom. if h. pylori are present, the bacteria will convert the urea into carbon dioxide. after a few minutes, the patient breathes into a container, exhaling carbon dioxide. a nurse or technician will perform this test at a health care provider's office or a commercial facility and send the samples to a lab. if the test detects the labeled carbon atoms in the exhaled breath, the health care provider will confirm an h. pylori infection in the gi tract."

how to diagnose abdominal adhesions ?,"abdominal adhesions cannot be detected by tests or seen through imaging techniques such as x rays or ultrasound. most abdominal adhesions are found during surgery performed to examine the abdomen. however, abdominal x rays, a lower gastrointestinal (gi) series, and computerized tomography (ct) scans can diagnose intestinal obstructions. - abdominal x rays use a small amount of radiation to create an image that is recorded on film or a computer. an x ray is performed at a hospital or an outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging. an x ray does not require anesthesia. the person will lie on a table or stand during the x ray. the x-ray machine is positioned over the abdominal area. the person will hold his or her breath as the picture is taken so that the picture will not be blurry. the person may be asked to change position for additional pictures. - a lower gi series is an x-ray exam that is used to look at the large intestine. the test is performed at a hospital or an outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. anesthesia is not needed. the health care provider may provide written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. the person may be asked to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before the procedure. a laxative or an enema may be used before the test. a laxative is medication that loosens stool and increases bowel movements. an enema involves fl ushing water or laxative into the rectum using a special squirt bottle. for the test, the person will lie on a table while the radiologist inserts a flexible tube into the persons anus. the large intestine is fi lled with barium, making signs of underlying problems show up more clearly on x rays. - ct scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. the procedure is performed at a hospital or an outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. anesthesia is not needed. a ct scan may include the injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. the person will lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken."
how to diagnose porphyria ?,"a health care provider diagnoses porphyria with blood, urine, and stool tests. these tests take place at a health care providers office or a commercial facility. a blood test involves drawing blood and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. for urine and stool tests, the patient collects a sample of urine or stool in a special container. a health care provider tests the samples in the office or sends them to a lab for analysis. high levels of porphyrins or porphyrin precursors in blood, urine, or stool indicate porphyria. a health care provider may also recommend dna testing of a blood sample to look for known gene mutations that cause porphyrias."
what are the symptoms of polycystic kidney disease ?,"in many cases, pkd does not cause signs or symptoms until cysts are half an inch or larger. when present, the most common symptoms are pain in the back and sidesbetween the ribs and hipsand headaches. the pain can be temporary or persistent, mild or severe. hematuriablood in the urinemay also be a sign of autosomal dominant pkd."
what are the symptoms of polycystic kidney disease ?,"an early sign of autosomal recessive pkd is an enlarged kidney, seen in a fetus or an infant using ultrasound. kidney function is crucial for early physical development, so children with autosomal recessive pkd and decreased kidney function are usually smaller-than-average size, a condition called growth failure. some people with autosomal recessive pkd do not develop signs or symptoms until later in childhood or even adulthood."
what to do for polycystic kidney disease ?,"a dietitian specializes in helping people who have kidney disease choose the right foods and plan healthy meals. people with any kind of kidney disease, including pkd, should talk with a dietitian about foods that should be added to their diet and foods that might be harmful. pkd may require diet changes for blood pressure control. kidney disease in general also calls for certain diet changes. following a healthy eating plan can help lower blood pressure. a health care provider may recommend the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (dash) eating plan, which focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and lower in sodium, which often comes from salt. the dash eating plan - is low in fat and cholesterol - features fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products, fish, poultry, and nuts - suggests less red meat, sweets, added sugars, and sugar-containing beverages - is rich in nutrients, protein, and fiber more information about the dash eating planis available from the national heart, lung, and blood institute. as your kidneys become more damaged, you may need to eat foods that are lower in phosphorus and potassium. the health care provider will use lab tests to watch your levels. foods high in potassium include - bananas - oranges - potatoes - tomatoes lower-potassium foods include - apples - peaches - carrots - green beans foods higher in phosphorus include - large portions of meat, fish and dairy foods - bran cereals and oatmeal - beans and nuts - colas lower-phosphorus alternatives include - fresh fruits and vegetables - breads - pasta - rice - corn and rice cereals - light-colored sodas people with kidney disease and high blood pressure should also limit how much sodium they get to 2,300 mg or less each day.5 people with ckd may need to watch how much protein they eat. everyone needs protein. however, protein breaks down into wastes the kidneys must remove. large amounts of protein make the kidneys work harder. high-quality proteins such as meat, fish, and eggs create fewer wastes than other sources of protein. beans, whole grains, soy products, nuts and nut butters, and dairy products can also be good sources of protein. most people eat more protein than they need. eating high-quality protein and smaller portions of protein can help protect the kidneys. more information about nutrition for kidney disease is provided in the niddk health topics: - nutrition for children with chronic kidney disease - nutrition for adults with early chronic kidney disease - nutrition for adults with advanced chronic kidney disease the national kidney disease education program offers a series of easy-to-read fact sheets about nutrition for people with ckd."
what to do for polycystic kidney disease ?,"- polycystic kidney disease (pkd) is a genetic disorder that causes numerous cysts to grow in the kidneys. - a gene mutation, or defect, causes polycystic kidney disease. - autosomal dominant pkd is the most common form of pkd and the most common inherited disorder of the kidneys. - health care providers identify most cases of autosomal dominant pkd between the ages of 30 and 50. - the most common symptoms of pkd are pain in the back and sidesbetween the ribs and hipsand headaches. the pain can be temporary or persistent, mild or severe. hematuriablood in the urinemay also be a sign of autosomal dominant pkd. - the complications of autosomal dominant pkd include the following: - pain - high blood pressure - kidney failure - urinary tract infections (utis) - kidney stones - liver cysts - pancreatic cysts - abnormal heart valves - diverticula - brain aneurysms - a health care provider diagnoses autosomal dominant pkd using imaging tests and genetic testing. - a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imagingwill interpret the images produced by the following imaging tests: - ultrasound - computerized tomography scans - magnetic resonance imaging - genetic testing can show whether a persons cells carry a gene mutation that causes autosomal dominant pkd. a health care provider may also use genetic testing results to determine whether someone with a family history of pkd is likely to develop the disorder in the future. prenatal testing can diagnose autosomal recessive pkd in unborn children. - although a cure for autosomal dominant pkd is not currently available, treatment can ease symptoms and prolong life. - autosomal recessive pkd is a rare genetic disorder that affects the liver as well as the kidneys. - the complications of autosomal recessive pkd include the following: - death due to breathing problems - kidney failure - liver scarring - high blood pressure - utis - a health care provider diagnoses autosomal recessive pkd with ultrasound imaging, even in a fetus or newborn. - treatments for autosomal recessive pkd focus on the symptoms and complications. - scientists have not yet found a way to prevent pkd. however, people with pkd may slow the progression of kidney damage caused by high blood pressure through lifestyle changes, diet, and blood pressure medications. - people with any kind of kidney disease, including pkd, should talk with a dietitian about foods they should add to their diet and foods that might be harmful."
what are the complications of perineal injury in males ?,"injury to the blood vessels, nerves, and muscles in the perineum can lead to complications such as - bladder control problems - sexual problems bladder control problems. the nerves in the perineum carry signals from the bladder to the spinal cord and brain, telling the brain when the bladder is full. those same nerves carry signals from the brain to the bladder and pelvic floor muscles, directing those muscles to hold or release urine. injury to those nerves can block or interfere with the signals, causing the bladder to squeeze at the wrong time or not to squeeze at all. damage to the pelvic floor muscles can cause bladder and bowel control problems. sexual problems. the perineal nerves also carry signals between the genitals and the brain. injury to those nerves can interfere with the sensations of sexual contact. signals from the brain direct the smooth muscles in the genitals to relax, causing greater blood flow into the penis. in men, damaged blood vessels can cause erectile dysfunction (ed), the inability to achieve or maintain an erection firm enough for sexual intercourse. an internal portion of the penis runs through the perineum and contains a section of the urethra. as a result, damage to the perineum may also injure the penis and urethra."
who is at risk for perineal injury in males? ?,"men who have perineal surgery are most likely to have an acute perineal injury. straddle injuries are most common among people who ride motorcycles, bikes, or horses and children who use playground equipment. impalement injuries are most common in military personnel engaged in combat. impalement injuries can also occur in construction or farm workers. chronic perineal injuries are most common in people who ride bikes as part of a job or sport, or in people with constipation."
what to do for perineal injury in males ?,"to prevent constipation, a diet with 20 to 35 grams of fiber each day helps the body form soft, bulky stool that is easier to pass. high-fiber foods include beans, whole grains and bran cereals, fresh fruits, and vegetables such as asparagus, brussels sprouts, cabbage, and carrots. for people prone to constipation, limiting foods that have little or no fiber, such as ice cream, cheese, meat, and processed foods, is also important. a health care provider can give information about how changes in eating, diet, and nutrition could help with constipation."
what to do for perineal injury in males ?,"- perineal injury is an injury to the perineum, the part of the body between the anus and the genitals, or sex organs. in males, the perineum is the area between the anus and the scrotum, the external pouch of skin that holds the testicles. - injury to the blood vessels, nerves, and muscles in the perineum can lead to complications such as - bladder control problems - sexual problems - common causes of acute perineal injury in males include - perineal surgery - straddle injuries - sexual abuse - impalement - chronic perineal injury most often results from a job- or sport-related practicesuch as bike, motorcycle, or horseback ridingor a long-term condition such as chronic constipation. - traumatic or piercing injuries may require surgery to repair damaged pelvic floor muscles, blood vessels, and nerves. treatment for these acute injuries may also include antibiotics to prevent infection. - in people with a chronic perineal injury, a health care provider will treat the complications of the condition, such as erectile dysfunction (ed) and urinary incontinence. - preventing perineal injury requires being aware of and taking steps to minimize the dangers of activities such as construction work or bike riding. - the national institute for occupational safety and health, part of the centers for disease control and prevention, recommends noseless seats for people who ride bikes as part of their job."
what are the complications of ectopic kidney ?,"possible complications of an ectopic kidney include problems with urine drainage from that kidney. sometimes, urine can even flow backwards from the bladder to the kidney, a problem called vesicoureteral reflux (vur). more information about vur is provided in the niddk health topic, vesicoureteral reflux. abnormal urine flow and the placement of the ectopic kidney can lead to various problems: - infection. normally, urine flow washes out bacteria and keeps them from growing in the kidneys and urinary tract. when a kidney is out of the usual position, urine may get trapped in the ureter or in the kidney itself. urine that remains in the urinary tract gives bacteria the chance to grow and spread. symptoms of a urinary tract infection include frequent or painful urination, back or abdominal pain, fever, chills, and cloudy or foul-smelling urine. - stones. urinary stones form from substances found in the urine, such as calcium and oxalate. when urine remains in the urinary tract for too long, the risk that these substances will have time to form stones is increased. symptoms of urinary stones include extreme pain in the back, side, or pelvis; blood in the urine; fever or chills; vomiting; and a burning feeling during urination. - kidney damage. if urine backs up all the way to the kidney, damage to the kidney can occur. as a result, the kidney cant filter wastes and extra water from the blood. one ectopic kidney, even when it has no function, will not cause kidney failure. the other kidney can usually perform the functions of two healthy kidneys. total kidney failure happens only in rare cases when both kidneys are damaged. - trauma. if the ectopic kidney is in the lower abdomen or pelvis, it may be susceptible to injury from blunt trauma. people with an ectopic kidney who want to participate in body contact sports may want to wear protective gear."
how to diagnose ectopic kidney ?,"a health care provider may use one or more of the following imaging tests to diagnose an ectopic kidney: - ultrasound. an ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. the procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging; anesthesia is not needed. the images can show the location of the kidneys. - intravenous pyelogram (ivp). an ivp is an x ray of the urinary tract. a special dye, called contrast medium, is injected into a vein in the persons arm, travels through the body to the kidneys, and makes urine visible on the x ray. the procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. an ivp can show a blockage in the urinary tract. in children, ultrasounds are usually done instead of ivps. - voiding cystourethrogram (vcug). a vcug is an x-ray image of the bladder and urethra taken while the bladder is full and during urination, also called voiding. the bladder and urethra are filled with contrast medium to make the structures clearly visible on the x-ray images. the x-ray machine captures images of the contrast medium while the bladder is full and when the person urinates. the procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by an x-ray technician supervised by a radiologist, who then interprets the images. anesthesia is not needed, but sedation may be used for some people. the test can show abnormalities of the inside of the urethra and bladder and whether urine is backing up toward the kidneys during urination. - radionuclide scan. a radionuclide scan is an imaging technique that relies on the detection of small amounts of radiation after injection of radioactive chemicals. because the dose of the radioactive chemicals is small, the risk of causing damage to cells is low. special cameras and computers are used to create images of the radioactive chemicals as they pass through the kidneys. the procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. this test can show the location of an ectopic kidney and whether the ureters are blocked. - magnetic resonance imaging (mri). mri machines use radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. an mri may include the injection of contrast medium. with most mri machines, the person lies on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end; some newer machines are designed to allow the person to lie in a more open space. the procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed though light sedation may be used for people with a fear of confined spaces. mris can show the location of the kidneys. in addition to imaging tests, blood tests may be done to determine how well the kidneys are working. these tests are almost always normal in people with an ectopic kidney, even if it is badly damaged, because the other kidney usually has completely normal function."
what are the symptoms of hematuria (blood in the urine) ?,"most people with microscopic hematuria do not have symptoms. people with gross hematuria have urine that is pink, red, or cola-colored due to the presence of red blood cells (rbcs). even a small amount of blood in the urine can cause urine to change color. in most cases, people with gross hematuria do not have other symptoms. however, people with gross hematuria that includes blood clots in the urine may have pain."
what is (are) glomerular diseases ?,"the two kidneys are bean-shaped organs located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. everyday, the two kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra fluid. blood enters the kidneys through arteries that branch inside the kidneys into tiny clusters of looping blood vessels. each cluster is called a glomerulus, which comes from the greek word meaning filter. the plural form of the word is glomeruli. there are approximately 1 million glomeruli, or filters, in each kidney. the glomerulus is attached to the opening of a small fluid-collecting tube called a tubule. blood is filtered in the glomerulus, and extra fluid and wastes pass into the tubule and become urine. eventually, the urine drains from the kidneys into the bladder through larger tubes called ureters. each glomerulus-and-tubule unit is called a nephron. each kidney is composed of about 1 million nephrons. in healthy nephrons, the glomerular membrane that separates the blood vessel from the tubule allows waste products and extra water to pass into the tubule while keeping blood cells and protein in the bloodstream."
what is (are) glomerular diseases ?,"renal failure is any acute or chronic loss of kidney function and is the term used when some kidney function remains. total kidney failure, sometimes called end-stage renal disease (esrd), indicates permanent loss of kidney function. depending on the form of glomerular disease, renal function may be lost in a matter of days or weeks or may deteriorate slowly and gradually over the course of decades. acute renal failure a few forms of glomerular disease cause very rapid deterioration of kidney function. for example, psgn can cause severe symptoms (hematuria, proteinuria, edema) within 2 to 3 weeks after a sore throat or skin infection develops. the patient may temporarily require dialysis to replace renal function. this rapid loss of kidney function is called acute renal failure (arf). although arf can be life-threatening while it lasts, kidney function usually returns after the cause of the kidney failure has been treated. in many patients, arf is not associated with any permanent damage. however, some patients may recover from arf and subsequently develop ckd. chronic kidney disease most forms of glomerular disease develop gradually, often causing no symptoms for many years. ckd is the slow, gradual loss of kidney function. some forms of ckd can be controlled or slowed down. for example, diabetic nephropathy can be delayed by tightly controlling blood glucose levels and using ace inhibitors and arbs to reduce proteinuria and control blood pressure. but ckd cannot be cured. partial loss of renal function means that some portion of the patient's nephrons have been scarred, and scarred nephrons cannot be repaired. in many cases, ckd leads to total kidney failure. total kidney failure to stay alive, a patient with total kidney failure must go on dialysishemodialysis or peritoneal dialysisor receive a new kidney through transplantation. patients with ckd who are approaching total kidney failure should learn as much about their treatment options as possible so they can make an informed decision when the time comes. with the help of dialysis or transplantation, many people continue to lead full, productive lives after reaching total kidney failure."
what are the symptoms of am i at risk for type 2 diabetes? taking steps to lower your risk of getting diabetes ?,"the signs and symptoms of type 2 diabetes can be so mild that you might not even notice them. nearly 7 million people in the united states have type 2 diabetes and dont know they have the disease. many have no signs or symptoms. some people have symptoms but do not suspect diabetes. symptoms include - increased thirst - increased hunger - fatigue - increased urination, especially at night - unexplained weight loss - blurred vision - numbness or tingling in the feet or hands - sores that do not heal many people do not find out they have the disease until they have diabetes problems, such as blurred vision or heart trouble. if you find out early that you have diabetes, you can get treatment to prevent damage to your body."
what causes insulin resistance and prediabetes ?,"although the exact causes of insulin resistance are not completely understood, scientists think the major contributors to insulin resistance are excess weight and physical inactivity. excess weight some experts believe obesity, especially excess fat around the waist, is a primary cause of insulin resistance. scientists used to think that fat tissue functioned solely as energy storage. however, studies have shown that belly fat produces hormones and other substances that can cause serious health problems such as insulin resistance, high blood pressure, imbalanced cholesterol, and cardiovascular disease (cvd). belly fat plays a part in developing chronic, or long-lasting, inflammation in the body. chronic inflammation can damage the body over time, without any signs or symptoms. scientists have found that complex interactions in fat tissue draw immune cells to the area and trigger low-level chronic inflammation. this inflammation can contribute to the development of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cvd. studies show that losing the weight can reduce insulin resistance and prevent or delay type 2 diabetes. physical inactivity many studies have shown that physical inactivity is associated with insulin resistance, often leading to type 2 diabetes. in the body, more glucose is used by muscle than other tissues. normally, active muscles burn their stored glucose for energy and refill their reserves with glucose taken from the bloodstream, keeping blood glucose levels in balance. studies show that after exercising, muscles become more sensitive to insulin, reversing insulin resistance and lowering blood glucose levels. exercise also helps muscles absorb more glucose without the need for insulin. the more muscle a body has, the more glucose it can burn to control blood glucose levels. other causes other causes of insulin resistance may include ethnicity; certain diseases; hormones; steroid use; some medications; older age; sleep problems, especially sleep apnea; and cigarette smoking. does sleep matter? yes. studies show that untreated sleep problems, especially sleep apnea, can increase the risk of obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. night shift workers may also be at increased risk for these problems. sleep apnea is a common disorder in which a person's breathing is interrupted during sleep. people may often move out of deep sleep and into light sleep when their breathing pauses or becomes shallow. this results in poor sleep quality that causes problem sleepiness, or excessive tiredness, during the day. many people aren't aware of their symptoms and aren't diagnosed. people who think they might have sleep problems should talk with their health care provider. more information about sleep problems is available from the national heart, lung, and blood institute at http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/resources/sleep."
what is (are) renal artery stenosis ?,"renal artery stenosis is the narrowing of one or both renal arteries. renal means kidney and stenosis means narrowing. the renal arteries are blood vessels that carry blood to the kidneys from the aortathe main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to arteries throughout the body. rvh is high blood pressure caused by ras. blood pressure is written with two numbers separated by a slash, 120/80, and is said as 120 over 80. the top number is called the systolic pressure and represents the pressure as the heart beats and pushes blood through the blood vessels. the bottom number is called the diastolic pressure and represents the pressure as blood vessels relax between heartbeats. a persons blood pressure is considered normal if it stays at or below 120/80. high blood pressure is a systolic pressure of 140 or above or a diastolic pressure of 90 or above.1"
what is (are) renal artery stenosis ?,"the kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. they are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. every day, the two kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra fluid."
what to do for renal artery stenosis ?,"limiting intake of fats, cholesterol, sodium, and sugar can help prevent atherosclerosis, which can lead to ras. most sodium in the diet comes from salt. a healthy diet that prevents people from becoming overweight or obese can also help prevent atherosclerosis. people with ras that has caused decreased kidney function should limit their intake of protein, cholesterol, sodium, and potassium to slow the progression of kidney failure. more information about nutrition for ckd is provided in the niddk health topics, nutrition for early chronic kidney disease in adults and nutrition for advanced chronic kidney disease in adults. people should talk with their health care provider about what diet is right for them."
what to do for renal artery stenosis ?,"- renal artery stenosis (ras) is the narrowing of one or both renal arteries. the renal arteries are blood vessels that carry blood to the kidneys from the aortathe main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to arteries throughout the body. - renovascular hypertension (rvh) is high blood pressure caused by ras. - about 90 percent of ras is caused by atherosclerosis. most other cases of ras are caused by fibromuscular dysplasia (fmd), which can cause blood vessels to narrow. - ras often has no symptoms until it becomes severe. the first symptoms of ras are usually either high blood pressure or decreased kidney function, or both, but ras is often overlooked as a cause of high blood pressure. - people with ras are at increased risk for chronic kidney disease (ckd), coronary artery disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. - imaging tests used to diagnose ras include duplex ultrasound, catheter angiogram, computerized tomographic angiography (cta) scan, and magnetic resonance angiogram (mra). - treatment for ras includes lifestyle changes, medications, and surgery."
what are the symptoms of amyloidosis and kidney disease ?,"the most common sign of primary amyloidosis of the kidneys is nephrotic syndromea collection of signs that indicate kidney damage. the signs of nephrotic syndrome include - albuminuriaan increased amount of albumin, a protein, in the urine. a person with nephrotic syndrome excretes more than half a teaspoon of albumin per day. - hyperlipidemiaa condition in which a persons blood has more-than-normal amounts of fats and cholesterol. - edemaswelling, typically in a persons legs, feet, or ankles and less often in the hands or face. - hypoalbuminemiaa condition in which a persons blood has less-than-normal amounts of albumin. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, nephrotic syndrome in adults. other signs and symptoms of primary amyloidosis may include - fatigue, or feeling tired - shortness of breath - low blood pressure - numbness, tingling, or a burning sensation in the hands or feet - weight loss"
what are the symptoms of amyloidosis and kidney disease ?,"the symptoms of dialysis-related amyloidosis may include - pain, stiffness, and fluid in the joints. - abnormal, fluid-containing sacs, called cysts, in some bones. - carpal tunnel syndrome, caused by unusual buildup of amyloid proteins in the wrists. the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include numbness or tingling, sometimes associated with muscle weakness, in the fingers and hands. dialysis-related amyloidosis most often affects bones, joints, and the tissues that connect muscle to bone, called tendons. the disease may also affect the digestive tract and organs such as the heart and lungs. bone cysts caused by dialysis-related amyloidosis can lead to bone fractures. dialysis-related amyloidosis can also cause tears in tendons and ligaments. ligaments are tissues that connect bones to other bones."
how to diagnose renal tubular acidosis ?,"to diagnose rta, doctors check the acid-base balance in blood and urine samples. if the blood is more acidic than it should be and the urine less acidic than it should be, rta may be the reason, but additional information is needed to rule out other causes. if rta is the reason, additional information about the sodium, potassium, and chloride levels in the urine and the potassium level in the blood will help identify which type of rta a person has. in all cases, the first goal of therapy is to neutralize acid in the blood, but different treatments may be needed to address the different underlying causes of acidosis."
what causes kidney dysplasia ?,"genetic factors can cause kidney dysplasia. genes pass information from both parents to the child and determine the childs traits. sometimes, parents may pass a gene that has changed, or mutated, causing kidney dysplasia. genetic syndromes that affect multiple body systems can also cause kidney dysplasia. a syndrome is a group of symptoms or conditions that may seem unrelated yet are thought to have the same genetic cause. a baby with kidney dysplasia due to a genetic syndrome might also have problems of the digestive tract, nervous system, heart and blood vessels, muscles and skeleton, or other parts of the urinary tract. a baby may also develop kidney dysplasia if his or her mother takes certain prescription medications during pregnancy, such as some used to treat seizures and high blood pressure. a mothers use of illegal drugs, such as cocaine, during pregnancy may also cause kidney dysplasia in her unborn child."
how many people are affected by kidney dysplasia ?,"kidney dysplasia is a common condition. scientists estimate that kidney dysplasia affects about one in 4,000 babies.1 this estimate may be low because some people with kidney dysplasia are never diagnosed with the condition. about half of the babies diagnosed with this condition have other urinary tract defects.2"
what are the complications of kidney dysplasia ?,"the complications of kidney dysplasia can include - hydronephrosis of the working kidney. a baby with kidney dysplasia in only one kidney might have other urinary tract defects. when other defects in the urinary tract block the flow of urine, the urine backs up and causes the kidneys and ureters to swell, a condition called hydronephrosis. if left untreated, hydronephrosis can damage the working kidney and reduce its ability to filter blood. kidney damage may lead to chronic kidney disease (ckd) and kidney failure. - a urinary tract infection (uti). a urine blockage may increase a babys chance of developing a uti. recurring utis can also lead to kidney damage. - high blood pressure. - a slightly increased chance of developing kidney cancer. more information is provided in the niddk health topics, urine blockage in newbornsand utis in children."

how to diagnose diagnosis of diabetes and prediabetes ?,"blood tests are used to diagnosis diabetes and prediabetes because early in the disease type 2 diabetes may have no symptoms. all diabetes blood tests involve drawing blood at a health care providers office or commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. lab analysis of blood is needed to ensure test results are accurate. glucose measuring devices used in a health care providers office, such as finger-stick devices, are not accurate enough for diagnosis but may be used as a quick indicator of high blood glucose. testing enables health care providers to find and treat diabetes before complications occur and to find and treat prediabetes, which can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes from developing. any one of the following tests can be used for diagnosis:* - an a1c test, also called the hemoglobin a1c, hba1c, or glycohemoglobin test - a fasting plasma glucose (fpg) test - an oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt) *not all tests are recommended for diagnosing all types of diabetes. see the individual test descriptions for details. another blood test, the random plasma glucose (rpg) test, is sometimes used to diagnose diabetes during a regular health checkup. if the rpg measures 200 milligrams per deciliter or above, and the individual also shows symptoms of diabetes, then a health care provider may diagnose diabetes. symptoms of diabetes include - increased urination - increased thirst - unexplained weight loss other symptoms can include fatigue, blurred vision, increased hunger, and sores that do not heal. any test used to diagnose diabetes requires confirmation with a second measurement unless clear symptoms of diabetes exist. the following table provides the blood test levels for diagnosis of diabetes for nonpregnant adults and diagnosis of prediabetes. a1c test the a1c test is used to detect type 2 diabetes and prediabetes but is not recommended for diagnosis of type 1 diabetes or gestational diabetes. the a1c test is a blood test that reflects the average of a persons blood glucose levels over the past 3 months and does not show daily fluctuations. the a1c test is more convenient for patients than the traditional glucose tests because it does not require fasting and can be performed at any time of the day. the a1c test result is reported as a percentage. the higher the percentage, the higher a persons blood glucose levels have been. a normal a1c level is below 5.7 percent. an a1c of 5.7 to 6.4 percent indicates prediabetes. people diagnosed with prediabetes may be retested in 1 year. people with an a1c below 5.7 percent maystill be at risk for diabetes, depending on the presence of other characteristics that put them at risk, also known as risk factors. people with an a1c above 6.0 percent should be considered at very high risk of developing diabetes. a level of 6.5 percent or above means a person has diabetes. laboratory analysis. when the a1c test is used for diagnosis, the blood sample must be sent to a laboratory using a method that is certified by the ngsp to ensure the results are standardized. blood samples analyzed in a health care providers office, known as point-of-care tests, are not standardized for diagnosing diabetes. abnormal results. the a1c test can be unreliable for diagnosing or monitoring diabetes in people with certain conditions known to interfere with the results. interference should be suspected when a1c results seem very different from the results of a blood glucose test. people of african, mediterranean, or southeast asian descent or people with family members with sickle cell anemia or a thalassemia are particularly at risk of interference. however, not all of the a1c tests are unreliable for people with these diseases. the ngsp provides information about which a1c tests are appropriate to use for specific types of interference and details on any problems with the a1c test at www.ngsp.org. false a1c test results may also occur in people with other problems that affect their blood or hemoglobin such as chronic kidney disease, liver disease, or anemia. more information about limitations of the a1c test and different forms of sickle cell anemia is provided in the niddk health topic, for people of african, mediterranean, or southeast asian heritage: important information about diabetes blood tests, or by calling 18008608747. changes in diagnostic testing in the past, the a1c test was used to monitor blood glucose levels but not for diagnosis. the a1c test has now been standardized, and in 2009, an international expert committee recommended it be used for diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and prediabetes.2 more information about the a1c test is provided in the niddk health topic, the a1c test and diabetes, or by calling 18008608747. fasting plasma glucose test the fpg test is used to detect diabetes and prediabetes. the fpg test has been the most common test used for diagnosing diabetes because it is more convenient than the ogtt and less expensive. the fpg test measures blood glucose in a person who has fasted for at least 8 hours and is most reliable when given in the morning. people with a fasting glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dl have impaired fasting glucose (ifg), or prediabetes. a level of 126 mg/dl or above, confirmed by repeating the test on another day, means a person has diabetes. oral glucose tolerance test the ogtt can be used to diagnose diabetes, prediabetes, and gestational diabetes. research has shown that the ogtt is more sensitive than the fpg test, but it is less convenient to administer. when used to test for diabetes or prediabetes, the ogtt measures blood glucose after a person fasts for at least 8 hours and 2 hours after the person drinks a liquid containing 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water. if the 2-hour blood glucose level is between 140 and 199 mg/dl, the person has a type of prediabetes called impaired glucose tolerance (igt). if confirmed by a second test, a 2-hour glucose level of 200 mg/dl or above means a person has diabetes."
how to diagnose diagnosis of diabetes and prediabetes ?,"health care providers test for gestational diabetes using the ogtt. women may be tested during their first visit to the health care provider after becoming pregnant or between 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy depending on their risk factors and symptoms. women found to have diabetes at the first visit to the health care provider after becoming pregnant may be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. defining safe blood glucose levels for pregnancy many studies have shown that gestational diabetes can cause complications for the mother and baby. an international, multicenter study, the hyperglycemia and adverse pregnancy outcome (hapo) study, showed that the higher a pregnant womans blood glucose is, the higher her risk of pregnancy complications. the hapo researchers found that pregnancy complications can occur at blood glucose levels that were once considered to be normal. based on the results of the hapo study, new guidelines for diagnosis of gestational diabetes were recommended by the international association of the diabetes and pregnancy study groups in 2011. so far, the new guidelines have been adopted by the american diabetes association (ada)3 but not by the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists (acog)4 or other medical organizations. researchers estimate these new guidelines, if widely adopted, will increase the proportion of pregnant women diagnosed with gestational diabetes to nearly 18 percent.5 both ada and acog guidelines for using the ogtt in diagnosing gestational diabetes are shown in the following tables. recommendations for testing pregnant women for diabetes time of testing acog ada at first visit during pregnancy no recommendation test women with risk factors for diabetes using standard testing for diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. women found to have diabetes at this time should be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, not gestational diabetes. at 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy test women for diabetes based on their history, risk factors, or a 50-gram, 1-hour, nonfasting, glucose challenge testa modified ogtt. if score is 130140 mg/dl, test again with fasting, 100-gram, 3-hour ogtt.* test all women for diabetes who are not already diagnosed, using a fasting, 75-gram, 2-hour ogtt.* ogtt levels for diagnosis of gestational diabetes time of sample collection acog levels**,4 (mg/dl) ada levels3(mg/dl) 100-gram glucose drink 75-gram glucose drink fasting, before drinking glucose 95 or above 92 or above 1 hour after drinking glucose 180 or above 180 or above 2 hours after drinking glucose 155 or above 153 or above 3 hours after drinking glucose 140 or above not used requirements for diagnosis two or more of the above levels must be met one or more of the above levels must be met more information about treating gestational diabetes is provided in the niddk health topic, what i need to know about gestational diabetes, or by calling 18008608747."

what causes urinary tract infections in children ?,"most utis are caused by bacteria that live in the bowel. the bacterium escherichia coli (e. coli) causes the vast majority of utis. the urinary tract has several systems to prevent infection. the points where the ureters attach to the bladder act like one-way valves to prevent urine from backing up, or refluxing, toward the kidneys, and urination washes microbes out of the body. immune defenses also prevent infection. but despite these safeguards, infections still occur. certain bacteria have a strong ability to attach themselves to the lining of the urinary tract. children who often delay urination are more likely to develop utis. regular urination helps keep the urinary tract sterile by flushing away bacteria. holding in urine allows bacteria to grow. producing too little urine because of inadequate fluid intake can also increase the risk of developing a uti. chronic constipationa condition in which a child has fewer than two bowel movements a weekcan add to the risk of developing a uti. when the bowel is full of hard stool, it presses against the bladder and bladder neck, blocking the flow of urine and allowing bacteria to grow. some children develop utis because they are prone to such infections, just as other children are prone to getting coughs, colds, or ear infections."
who is at risk for foodborne illnesses? ?,"anyone can get a foodborne illness. however, some people are more likely to develop foodborne illnesses than others, including - infants and children - pregnant women and their fetuses - older adults - people with weak immune systems these groups also have a greater risk of developing severe symptoms or complications of foodborne illnesses."

what is (are) vesicoureteral reflux ?,"vesicoureteral reflux is the abnormal flow of urine from the bladder to the upper urinary tract. the urinary tract is the bodys drainage system for removing wastes and extra water. the urinary tract includes two kidneys, two ureters, a bladder, and a urethra. blood flows through the kidneys, and the kidneys filter out wastes and extra water, making urine. the urine travels down two narrow tubes called the ureters. the urine is then stored in a balloonlike organ called the bladder. when the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra at the bottom of the bladder. in vur, urine may flow backrefluxinto one or both ureters and, in some cases, to one or both kidneys. vur that affects only one ureter and kidney is called unilateral reflux, and vur that affects both ureters and kidneys is called bilateral reflux."
what is (are) vesicoureteral reflux ?,"the two types of vur are primary and secondary. most cases of vur are primary and typically affect only one ureter and kidney. with primary vur, a child is born with a ureter that did not grow long enough during the childs development in the womb. the valve formed by the ureter pressing against the bladder wall does not close properly, so urine refluxes from the bladder to the ureter and eventually to the kidney. this type of vur can get better or disappear as a child gets older. as a child grows, the ureter gets longer and function of the valve improves. secondary vur occurs when a blockage in the urinary tract causes an increase in pressure and pushes urine back up into the ureters. children with secondary vur often have bilateral reflux. vur caused by a physical defect typically results from an abnormal fold of tissue in the urethra that keeps urine from flowing freely out of the bladder. vur is usually classified as grade i through v, with grade i being the least severe and grade v being the most severe."
